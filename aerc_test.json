        "IBM has just announced the invention of the PAN-Personal Area Network-a set of devices that use humans as conductors to relay detailed textual information from one person to another, simply by touch. It is a relatively small conceptual step from the PAN processor that relays a written message through one\u2019s body by a shake of the hand to a microcell sensory transmission system that relays ideas and sensations directly to and from the most powerful processor in the world, the human brain.\nWithin a few decades, PAN-type research will transform the Internet into the Life Net, a comprehensive sensory environment for human habitation. Our minds will be afforded wireless direct sensory interfacing with other people and various databases. A dramatically enhanced version of what we now call virtual reality will become as common as air conditioning. Telephones, TVs, PCs, and other media will be replaced by wireless sensory feeds from and to communal microcells.\nPeople return to the Internet each day not from addiction, but because they can craft a new identity for themselves-any identity they choose. Or they can participate in experiences that are otherwise beyond their reach. Consider the impact of a technology affording a lifestyle in which you can go wherever you want to go and be whoever you want to be.\nToday\u2019s office and service workers have diminished physical capabilities, but are better educated. The Life Net will accelerate this trend. The need to survive while spending weeks, months, or years on the Net would be drastically reduced.\nResource depletion resulting from overpopulation will cease to be a major issue when we are subsisting on 600 calories a day in a sensory reality where we can eat all we want. Our mansions will be built in our minds, and our furore Ferrairs will be driven along the roads of our collective imaginations. Our minds will work and play in ways now beyond our conception.\nTime constraints dissolve when we can communicate effortlessly anywhere in the world. Humans will require less sleep, since we will need only the time to file and store the information that our brains have collected, and not to rest physical bodies. The physical body will deteriorate to a state where a return to robust health would take months-if possible at all.\nThese technologies will be inexpensive. Life Net participation will consume far fewer resources than an automobile, and reduce our housing and other needs. This will help the Life Net expand into Third World countries. The equipment required for the microcellular sensory transmission technology will be modular, redundant, and like that for the Internet, incrementally inexpensive. Countries with overcrowding and famine would embrace the Life Net. Their resources would be extended, and planners would likely program the system to minimize the population\u2019s reproductive drive.\nPeople will still have jobs. There will be lots of work to do. People will want to consume the newest experiential sensations. Some food will need to be prepared, and equipment manufactured. Government will be divided into Geographical, Physical and Communicative. The responsibilities of the geographic governments will be to defend land masses and keep order in the physical world as much as they do today. The responsibilities of the communicative governments will be to administer, regulate and defend cyberspace. The communicative government will also be responsible for maintaining the input-output microcells. Various online services are already functioning as a form of communicative government today-with their monthly fees as taxes. As they mature, these communicative governments will develop better defenses against cyberspace terrorism, which may come from large and potentially violent anti-technology cults.\nSome people will have to remain physically active and strong, because of the nature of their labor. Tools and equipment will always break down and need repair, and some operations and experiments will require a hands-on approach. Manufacturers, natural resource harvesters and explorers of all sorts are likely to be visitors to the Life Net, rather than residents.\nManufacturing will be dramatically reduced, because few people will need cars, clothing, physical tools, or countless other physical objects. Natural resource harvesters will work in every field from farming to mining. Yet as with manufacturing, the need for harvesting will decrease.\nFifty years from now, reality will consist of some wonderful things, some beautiful things, and some deeply frightening things.",

        "Western Juries have traditionally found eyewitness testimony to be the most convincing evidence in criminal trials. Seeing is believing, as the saying goes. In numerous cases, when witnesses pointed to the defendant, his or her fate was sealed. But how reliable is eyewitness testimony? Recent cases have suggested that despite our best intentions, we may unwittingly distort what we perceive.\nArtists and psychologists have long known that \u201cseeing\u201d is not a simple matter of recording visual input. People perceive the exterior world through a complex matrix of cultural expectations, personality traits, moods and life experiences. For example, researchers tested the cultural influence on perception by showing a set of optical illusions to various groups, and found that different groups responded in divergent ways. Accustomed to and inundated by perpendicular structures, Western Europeans succumbed easily to illusions based on rectangular lines. On the other hand, the Zulu people of South Africa, whose environment had been comprised almost entirely of circular forms \uff08round houses, doors, etc.\uff09 did not fall prey to those linear illusions.\nCultural expectations also influence the selectivity of our seeing. The amount of visual information that exists far exceeds our ability to process it, so we must filter that sensory input into recognizable images. In looking at a face, we do not see elongated ovals set in complex shadows and shading, we see eyes. And that filtering process is informed by what we perceive to be significant, which is influenced by cultural norms. Some cultures may emphasize differences in hair color or texture, others the shape of a nose or mouth, others the set of the eyes.\nBut it is not only group expectations that color what we see, personality and mood fluctuation can also alter our perceptions. Orderly minds who shun ambiguity will see an off-center image as firmly fixed in the center. The same photograph of four young men allows for shifting interpretations based on our current feeling: a mood of happiness reveals boys enjoying a relaxing day, while anxiety changes the picture to students worrying about exams. In addition, numerous more prosaic factors affect our ability to record an image accurately. Duration of the encounter, proximity to the subject, lighting, and angle all affect our ability to see, and even stress may further undermine the accuracy of our perceptions.\nWhat will this mean for criminal trials? Juries have often been reluctant to convict without eyewitness identification. Blood samples, fingerprints, and the like do not resonate as deeply with juries as does direct testimony, and frequently require understanding of complex scientific technicalities.

The equipment required for the microcellular sensory transmission technology will be modular, redundant, and like that for the Internet, incrementally inexpensive. Countries with overcrowding and famine would embrace the Life Net. Their resources would be extended, and planners would likely program the system to minimize the population\u2019s reproductive drive.\nPeople will still have jobs. There will be lots of work to do. People will want to consume the newest experiential sensations. Some food will need to be prepared, and equipment manufactured. Government will be divided into Geographical, Physical and Communicative. The responsibilities of the geographic governments will be to defend land masses and keep order in the physical world as much as they do today. The responsibilities of the communicative governments will be to administer, regulate and defend cyberspace. The communicative government will also be responsible for maintaining the input-output microcells. Various online services are already functioning as a form of communicative government today-with their monthly fees as taxes. As they mature, these communicative governments will develop better defenses against cyberspace terrorism, which may come from large and potentially violent anti-technology cults.\nSome people will have to remain physically active and strong, because of the nature of their labor. Tools and equipment will always break down and need repair, and some operations and experiments will require a hands-on approach. Manufacturers, natural resource harvesters and explorers of all sorts are likely to be visitors to the Life Net, rather than residents.\nManufacturing will be dramatically reduced, because few people will need cars, clothing, physical tools, or countless other physical objects. Natural resource harvesters will work in every field from farming to mining. Yet as with manufacturing, the need for harvesting will decrease.\nFifty years from now, reality will consist of some wonderful things, some beautiful things, and some deeply frightening things.",

        "Western Juries have traditionally found eyewitness testimony to be the most convincing evidence in criminal trials. Seeing is believing, as the saying goes. In numerous cases, when witnesses pointed to the defendant, his or her fate was sealed. But how reliable is eyewitness testimony? Recent cases have suggested that despite our best intentions, we may unwittingly distort what we perceive.\nArtists and psychologists have long known that \u201cseeing\u201d is not a simple matter of recording visual input. People perceive the exterior world through a complex matrix of cultural expectations, personality traits, moods and life experiences. For example, researchers tested the cultural influence on perception by showing a set of optical illusions to various groups, and found that different groups responded in divergent ways. Accustomed to and inundated by perpendicular structures, Western Europeans succumbed easily to illusions based on rectangular lines. On the other hand, the Zulu people of South Africa, whose environment had been comprised almost entirely of circular forms \uff08round houses, doors, etc.\uff09 did not fall prey to those linear illusions.\nCultural expectations also influence the selectivity of our seeing. The amount of visual information that exists far exceeds our ability to process it, so we must filter that sensory input into recognizable images. In looking at a face, we do not see elongated ovals set in complex shadows and shading, we see eyes. And that filtering process is informed by what we perceive to be significant, which is influenced by cultural norms. Some cultures may emphasize differences in hair color or texture, others the shape of a nose or mouth, others the set of the eyes.\nBut it is not only group expectations that color what we see, personality and mood fluctuation can also alter our perceptions. Orderly minds who shun ambiguity will see an off-center image as firmly fixed in the center. The same photograph of four young men allows for shifting interpretations based on our current feeling: a mood of happiness reveals boys enjoying a relaxing day, while anxiety changes the picture to students worrying about exams. In addition, numerous more prosaic factors affect our ability to record an image accurately. Duration of the encounter, proximity to the subject, lighting, and angle all affect our ability to see, and even stress may further undermine the accuracy of our perceptions.\nWhat will this mean for criminal trials? Juries have often been reluctant to convict without eyewitness identification. Blood samples, fingerprints, and the like do not resonate as deeply with juries as does direct testimony, and frequently require understanding of complex scientific technicalities. But as confidence in eyewitness testimony wanes, such circumstantial evidence may someday replace visual identification as the lynchpin of criminal trials.",

The physical body will deteriorate to a state where a return to robust health would take months-if possible at all.\nThese technologies will be inexpensive. Life Net participation will consume far fewer resources than an automobile, and reduce our housing and other needs. This will help the Life Net expand into Third World countries.

        "Children\u2019s literature traces its beginnings to preliterate times, when ancient storytellers passed tales and legends from generation to generation in the oral tradition. William Caxton, who established England\u2019s first printing press, published books of etiquette, fables and legends. However, these didn\u2019t constitute a body of work that could be considered literature for children. Because children at that time were considered \u201cminiature adults\u201d, books were didactic in nature. The content for young readers consisted mainly of religious instruction, rules of behavior, ethical messages, and moral platitudes. In 1774, Englishman John Newberry changed children\u2019s publishing when he began to create books with attractive formats, quality illustrations, and sturdy buildings, that were designed primarily for children to enjoy. The oldest, and most prestigious award given for children\u2019s books published in America, is the Newberry Medal.\nIn the following century, children\u2019s literature began to bloom. Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s wonderful stories like \u201cThe Ugly Duckling\u201d, and \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d, and Grimm brothers collected two volumes of German folktales that included stories such as \u201cSnow White\u201d and \u201cRumpelstiltskin\u201d. Childhood came to be recognized as a joyful and carefree period of life, and books celebrating it began to be published. Charles Dodgson \uff08Lewis Carrol\uff09 wrote the fantasy \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d, the first book that was intended purely for children\u2019s enjoyment without any pretense of instruction. Edwards Lear\u2019s books of nonsense poetry delighted both young and old readers. In North America, books for a young audience were becoming popular as well. Kate Douglas Wiggin wrote \u201cRebecca of Sunnybrook Farm\u201d, Louisa May Alcott wrote \u201cLittle Women\u201d, and Samuel Clemens \uff08Mark Twain\uff09 created Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. By the end of the century, the pious and moralistic books of earlier times had been replaced by writing designed to amuse and entertain a young audience. In the 1800s color printing was introduced, and by the middle of the 19th century, the rough illustrations that characterized earlier children\u2019s books had been replaced by works of art that captured the word and some of the story.",

        "IBM has just announced the invention of the PAN-Personal Area Network-a set of devices that use humans as conductors to relay detailed textual information from one person to another, simply by touch. It is a relatively small conceptual step from the PAN processor that relays a written message through one\u2019s body by a shake of the hand to a microcell sensory transmission system that relays ideas and sensations directly to and from the most powerful processor in the world, the human brain.\nWithin a few decades, PAN-type research will transform the Internet into the Life Net, a comprehensive sensory environment for human habitation. Our minds will be afforded wireless direct sensory interfacing with other people and various databases. A dramatically enhanced version of what we now call virtual reality will become as common as air conditioning. Telephones, TVs, PCs, and other media will be replaced by wireless sensory feeds from and to communal microcells.\nPeople return to the Internet each day not from addiction, but because they can craft a new identity for themselves-any identity they choose. Or they can participate in experiences that are otherwise beyond their reach. Consider the impact of a technology affording a lifestyle in which you can go wherever you want to go and be whoever you want to be.\nToday\u2019s office and service workers have diminished physical capabilities, but are better educated. The Life Net will accelerate this trend. The need to survive while spending weeks, months, or years on the Net would be drastically reduced.\nResource depletion resulting from overpopulation will cease to be a major issue when we are subsisting on 600 calories a day in a sensory reality where we can eat all we want. Our mansions will be built in our minds, and our furore Ferrairs will be driven along the roads of our collective imaginations. Our minds will work and play in ways now beyond our conception.\nTime constraints dissolve when we can communicate effortlessly anywhere in the world. Humans will require less sleep, since we will need only the time to file and store the information that our brains have collected, and not to rest physical bodies. The physical body will deteriorate to a state where a return to robust health would take months-if possible at all.\nThese technologies will be inexpensive. Life Net participation will consume far fewer resources than an automobile, and reduce our housing and other needs. This will help the Life Net expand into Third World countries. The equipment required for the microcellular sensory transmission technology will be modular, redundant, and like that for the Internet, incrementally inexpensive. Countries with overcrowding and famine would embrace the Life Net. Their resources would be extended, and planners would likely program the system to minimize the population\u2019s reproductive drive.\nPeople will still have jobs. There will be lots of work to do. People will want to consume the newest experiential sensations. Some food will need to be prepared, and equipment manufactured. Government will be divided into Geographical, Physical and Communicative. The responsibilities of the geographic governments will be to defend land masses and keep order in the physical world as much as they do today. The responsibilities of the communicative governments will be to administer, regulate and defend cyberspace. The communicative government will also be responsible for maintaining the input-output microcells. Various online services are already functioning as a form of communicative government today-with their monthly fees as taxes. As they mature, these communicative governments will develop better defenses against cyberspace terrorism, which may come from large and potentially violent anti-technology cults.\nSome people will have to remain physically active and strong, because of the nature of their labor. Tools and equipment will always break down and need repair, and some operations and experiments will require a hands-on approach. Manufacturers, natural resource harvesters and explorers of all sorts are likely to be visitors to the Life Net, rather than residents.\nManufacturing will be dramatically reduced, because few people will need cars, clothing, physical tools, or countless other physical objects. Natural resource harvesters will work in every field from farming to mining. Yet as with manufacturing, the need for harvesting will decrease.\nFifty years from now, reality will consist of some wonderful things, some beautiful things, and some deeply frightening things.",

They are all for sale. \u201cA forger? Yes. We\u2019re expert forgers you could say. But we make no attempt to deceive. We don\u2019t pretend to sell original works. We have all the thrill of being a forger, but no risk.\u201d\nWith prices for original art rising into the tens of millions, some art lovers are turning to high-quality copies done by expert artists. In addition, some museums confronting skyrocketing insurance premiums are considering stashing the authentic pieces and displaying a reproduction.\nNo major U. S. art museum is known to be displaying reproductions in place of originals. Such a practice would raise questions about why people visit museums in the first place. But museum security has become a growing concern.\nBids for paintings have climbed at auction houses. But prices for fakes run only from about $1,000 to $10,000 for paintings, depending on the size and complexity of the original.\nIn Europe where copying masterpieces is a centuries-old craft, painters often use pigments and brushes typical of the period of the original. The painting is placed in a frame closely resembling its era. Sometimes the gallery purchases 17th century furniture to use the wood for frames. The final step is the antiquing process using chemicals and heat and humidity. \u201cWe can make special types of cracks from little spider-web types to long splits.\u201d",

        "Is test anxiety destructive? Can we make test anxiety work for us? The answer to both of these questions is yes. Test anxiety often interferes with student performance but this same test anxiety, if channeled correctly, can help improve performance.\nIn order to lessen the destructive elements of test anxiety, the approach should be to develop improved confidence and knowledge. As your knowledge of the course material increases, your confidence in your ability to succeed will increase. As your confidence increases, your anxiety will go down, allowing your knowledge to come through more efficiently. The way you prepare for a test can reduce anxiety during the test.\nYou will be surprised how confident you will feel if you know the material. Studies of memory show if you want to be able to recall information from text or lecture you have to review that material several times. It is important to know your own abilities and operate accordingly. If you know that you learn best by listening, prepare a tape of significant material and listen to the tape.\nStudy partners or study groups are often useful for self-testing. Experience in stressful situations tends to lessen anxiety in those situations. One way to help yourself retrieve material is through the use of mnemonic codes. Learn a code that lets you remember complex material. Developing an outline for an essay question that you know will be on the test or memorizing a formula are forms of code development.\nStudents are often frustrated by the sheer volume of material that has to be studied in college. Many instructors conduct reviews, give hints, identify what is important to study, use handouts or overhead transparency outlines. These materials should be at the top of your study list. If the instructor took the time to identify them, you should assume that they will play an important part of the test. While knowledge acquired during test preparation can help reduce anxiety, it is another thing to take the test itself. Following are a few suggestions to help reduce anxiety during the test.\nWhen I arrive at a test, I often find students flipping text pages at the last minute trying to cram it all in at the end. You would be better off trying to relax, meditating a little, and clearing your mind to allow yourself the ability to concentrate on the questions that are coming.\nAs soon as the instructor gives you the signal to start, dump out formulas, codes, outlines from your memory onto the test answer sheets so that you will not have to worry about whether you will remember the codes long enough until you get to the appropriate test question.\nYou can build your confidence if you go through the test and answer all of the questions that you know first. Go back and work on those questions that need greater analysis, or that need to be worked out or need to be guessed at and your anxiety will not kick in until later in the test.\nFor those of you whose anxiety increases as study and preparation increase, your goal should be to start concentrating on things that take your mind off the test, i.e., television, books, hobbies, movies, etc. Meditation and aerobic exercise have proven to be very useful methods for reducing undesirable effects of stress.\nThe solution to reducing the destructive influences of stress is to plan to study. Map out a schedule of when you will study each day. Identify the specific topics that you will study, each day. Identify the areas of the material that you have had problems with and study those. Your plan should include reading the text material, reviewing notes and homework assignments, identifying material that needs further explanation, developing codes for memory material and testing yourself. Once you have studied adequately, your confidence will be fairly high, your knowledge will be satisfactory to do well on the test and the stomach butterflies will help you focus on the task at hand.\nI\u2019d wish you good luck on finals, but you and I both know that the more effectively you study, the luckier you will get.",

Map out a schedule of when you will study each day. Identify the specific topics that you will study, each day. Identify the areas of the material that you have had problems with and study those. Your plan should include reading the text material, reviewing notes and homework assignments, identifying material that needs further explanation, developing codes for memory material and testing yourself.

We have all the thrill of being a forger, but no risk.\u201d\nWith prices for original art rising into the tens of millions, some art lovers are turning to high-quality copies done by expert artists. In addition, some museums confronting skyrocketing insurance premiums are considering stashing the authentic pieces and displaying a reproduction.\nNo major U. S. art museum is known to be displaying reproductions in place of originals. Such a practice would raise questions about why people visit museums in the first place. But museum security has become a growing concern.\nBids for paintings have climbed at auction houses. But prices for fakes run only from about $1,000 to $10,000 for paintings, depending on the size and complexity of the original.\nIn Europe where copying masterpieces is a centuries-old craft, painters often use pigments and brushes typical of the period of the original. The painting is placed in a frame closely resembling its era. Sometimes the gallery purchases 17th century furniture to use the wood for frames. The final step is the antiquing process using chemicals and heat and humidity. \u201cWe can make special types of cracks from little spider-web types to long splits.\u201d",

As your knowledge of the course material increases, your confidence in your ability to succeed will increase. As your confidence increases, your anxiety will go down, allowing your knowledge to come through more efficiently. The way you prepare for a test can reduce anxiety during the test.\nYou will be surprised how confident you will feel if you know the material. Studies of memory show if you want to be able to recall information from text or lecture you have to review that material several times. It is important to know your own abilities and operate accordingly. If you know that you learn best by listening, prepare a tape of significant material and listen to the tape.\nStudy partners or study groups are often useful for self-testing. Experience in stressful situations tends to lessen anxiety in those situations. One way to help yourself retrieve material is through the use of mnemonic codes. Learn a code that lets you remember complex material. Developing an outline for an essay question that you know will be on the test or memorizing a formula are forms of code development.\nStudents are often frustrated by the sheer volume of material that has to be studied in college. Many instructors conduct reviews, give hints, identify what is important to study, use handouts or overhead transparency outlines. These materials should be at the top of your study list. If the instructor took the time to identify them, you should assume that they will play an important part of the test. While knowledge acquired during test preparation can help reduce anxiety, it is another thing to take the test itself. Following are a few suggestions to help reduce anxiety during the test.\nWhen I arrive at a test, I often find students flipping text pages at the last minute trying to cram it all in at the end. You would be better off trying to relax, meditating a little, and clearing your mind to allow yourself the ability to concentrate on the questions that are coming.\nAs soon as the instructor gives you the signal to start, dump out formulas, codes, outlines from your memory onto the test answer sheets so that you will not have to worry about whether you will remember the codes long enough until you get to the appropriate test question.\nYou can build your confidence if you go through the test and answer all of the questions that you know first. Go back and work on those questions that need greater analysis, or that need to be worked out or need to be guessed at and your anxiety will not kick in until later in the test.\nFor those of you whose anxiety increases as study and preparation increase, your goal should be to start concentrating on things that take your mind off the test, i.e., television, books, hobbies, movies, etc. Meditation and aerobic exercise have proven to be very useful methods for reducing undesirable effects of stress.\nThe solution to reducing the destructive influences of stress is to plan to study. Map out a schedule of when you will study each day. Identify the specific topics that you will study, each day. Identify the areas of the material that you have had problems with and study those. Your plan should include reading the text material, reviewing notes and homework assignments, identifying material that needs further explanation, developing codes for memory material and testing yourself. Once you have studied adequately, your confidence will be fairly high, your knowledge will be satisfactory to do well on the test and the stomach butterflies will help you focus on the task at hand.\nI\u2019d wish you good luck on finals, but you and I both know that the more effectively you study, the luckier you will get.",

        "Often conjuring images of dank, smelly, mosquito-infested wastelands, upon closer look, wetlands are actually biologically diverse and productive ecosystems. Home to a variety of plant life, including floating pond lilies, cattails, cypress, tamarack, and blue spruce, wetlands support diverse communities of invertebrates, which in turn support a wide variety of birds and other vertebrates. Primary consumers from crustaceans, mollusks, and aquatic insect larvae to muskrats, geese, and deer rely on the abundance of algae, plants, and detritus for food. Wetlands also support a variety of carnivores, including dragonflies, otters, alligators, and osprey. Thus, wetlands of the world maintain biologically diverse communities of ecological and economic value.\nMany ecologically and economically important species call wetlands home for at least part of their lives. For instance, commercially important fish and shellfish, including shrimp, blue crab, oysters, salmon, trout, and sea trout rely on, or are associated with, wetlands. Wetlands are also critical habitat for migratory birds and waterfowl, including ducks, egrets, and geese. In fact, more than one-third of the species listed as threatened or endangered in the United States live solely in wetlands and nearly half use wetlands at some point in their lives. As such, many wetlands are often recognized as important conservation or restoration targets.\nWhile covering only six percent of the Earth\u2019s surface, wetlands provide a disproportionately high number of ecosystem services, in addition to maintaining biodiversity. For instance, wetlands also mitigate floods, protect coastal areas from storms, improve water quality, recharge groundwater aquifers, serve as sinks, sources, or transformers of materials, and produce food and goods for human use. When evaluating the economic value of these various functions, scientists concluded that the economic value provided by wetland ecosystems exceeded that provided by lakes, streams, forests, and grasslands and was second only to that provided by coastal estuaries.\nWith mitigation, wetlands are created, restored, or enhanced to replace wetland loss due to development. The Ramsar Convention, an international treaty aimed at conserving wetlands, requires member countries to develop national wetland policies, to establish wetland reserves, and to designate one or more wetlands as an area of international importance. All these efforts are designed to protect or conserve wetlands and the ecosystem services they provide.\nIn coastal wetlands, tidal influence drives the movement and distribution of water and can range from permanent flooding in subtidal wetlands to less frequent flooding in others, with changes in water level occurring daily or semi-daily. Inland wetlands, which lack daily tidal influences, can also be permanently flooded on one extreme or intermittently flooded on the other extreme, with fluctuations over time often occurring seasonally. It is the balance of water inflows and outflows, or the water budget, as well as the geomorphology and soils that, determine the timing, duration, and patterns of flooding in a wetland.",

        "Often conjuring images of dank, smelly, mosquito-infested wastelands, upon closer look, wetlands are actually biologically diverse and productive ecosystems. Home to a variety of plant life, including floating pond lilies, cattails, cypress, tamarack, and blue spruce, wetlands support diverse communities of invertebrates, which in turn support a wide variety of birds and other vertebrates. Primary consumers from crustaceans, mollusks, and aquatic insect larvae to muskrats, geese, and deer rely on the abundance of algae, plants, and detritus for food. Wetlands also support a variety of carnivores, including dragonflies, otters, alligators, and osprey. Thus, wetlands of the world maintain biologically diverse communities of ecological and economic value.\nMany ecologically and economically important species call wetlands home for at least part of their lives. For instance, commercially important fish and shellfish, including shrimp, blue crab, oysters, salmon, trout, and sea trout rely on, or are associated with, wetlands. Wetlands are also critical habitat for migratory birds and waterfowl, including ducks, egrets, and geese. In fact, more than one-third of the species listed as threatened or endangered in the United States live solely in wetlands and nearly half use wetlands at some point in their lives. As such, many wetlands are often recognized as important conservation or restoration targets.\nWhile covering only six percent of the Earth\u2019s surface, wetlands provide a disproportionately high number of ecosystem services, in addition to maintaining biodiversity. For instance, wetlands also mitigate floods, protect coastal areas from storms, improve water quality, recharge groundwater aquifers, serve as sinks, sources, or transformers of materials, and produce food and goods for human use. When evaluating the economic value of these various functions, scientists concluded that the economic value provided by wetland ecosystems exceeded that provided by lakes, streams, forests, and grasslands and was second only to that provided by coastal estuaries.\nWith mitigation, wetlands are created, restored, or enhanced to replace wetland loss due to development. The Ramsar Convention, an international treaty aimed at conserving wetlands, requires member countries to develop national wetland policies, to establish wetland reserves, and to designate one or more wetlands as an area of international importance. All these efforts are designed to protect or conserve wetlands and the ecosystem services they provide.\nIn coastal wetlands, tidal influence drives the movement and distribution of water and can range from permanent flooding in subtidal wetlands to less frequent flooding in others, with changes in water level occurring daily or semi-daily. Inland wetlands, which lack daily tidal influences, can also be permanently flooded on one extreme or intermittently flooded on the other extreme, with fluctuations over time often occurring seasonally. It is the balance of water inflows and outflows, or the water budget, as well as the geomorphology and soils that, determine the timing, duration, and patterns of flooding in a wetland.",

        "From my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of my disposition. My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to make me the jest of my companions. I was especially fond of animals, and was indulged by my parents with a great variety of pets. With these I spent most of my time, and never was so happy as when feeding and caressing them. This peculiarity of character grew with my growth, and, in my manhood, I derived from it one of my principal sources of pleasure.\nTo those who have cherished an affection for a faithful dog, I hardly need to take the trouble of explaining the nature or the intensity of the gratification thus derivable. There is something in the unselfish and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly to the heart of the person who has had frequent occasions to test the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere Man.\nI married early, and was happy to find in my wife a disposition not uncongenial with my own. Observing my partiality for domestic pets, she lost no opportunity of procuring those of the most agreeable kind. We had birds, gold-fish, a fine dog, rabbits, a small monkey, and a cat. This latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal, entirely black, and sagacious to an astonishing degree. In speaking of his intelligence, my wife, who at heart was not a little tinctured with superstition, made frequent allusion of the ancient popular notion, which regarded all black cats as witches in disguise. Not that she was ever serious about this point\u2014and I mention the matter at all for no better reason than that it happens, just now, to be remembered.\nPluto\u2014this was the cat\u2019s name\u2014was my favorite pet and playmate. I alone fed him, and he attended me wherever I went about the house. It was even with difficulty that I could prevent him from following me through the streets. Our friendship lasted, in this manner, for several years, during which my general temperament and character\u2014through the instrumentality of the Fiend Intemperance\u2014had (I blush to confess it) experienced a radical alteration for the worse. I grew, day by day, more moody, more irritable, more regardless of the feelings of others. I suffered myself to use intemperate language with my wife. At length, I was even violent with her. My pets, of course, were made to feel the change in my disposition. I not only neglected, but ill-used them. For Pluto, however, I still retained sufficient regard to restrain me from maltreating him, as I made no scruple of maltreating the rabbits, the monkey, or even the dog, when by accident, or through affection, they came in my way.\nBut my disease grew upon me, and at length even Pluto, who was now becoming old, and consequently somewhat peevish\u2014even Pluto began to experience the effects of my ill temper. One night, returning home, much intoxicated, from one of my haunts about town, I fancied that the cat avoided my presence. I seized him; when, in his fright at any violence, he inflicted a slight wound upon my hand with his teeth.",

        "Often conjuring images of dank, smelly, mosquito-infested wastelands, upon closer look, wetlands are actually biologically diverse and productive ecosystems. Home to a variety of plant life, including floating pond lilies, cattails, cypress, tamarack, and blue spruce, wetlands support diverse communities of invertebrates, which in turn support a wide variety of birds and other vertebrates. Primary consumers from crustaceans, mollusks, and aquatic insect larvae to muskrats, geese, and deer rely on the abundance of algae, plants, and detritus for food. Wetlands also support a variety of carnivores, including dragonflies, otters, alligators, and osprey. Thus, wetlands of the world maintain biologically diverse communities of ecological and economic value.\nMany ecologically and economically important species call wetlands home for at least part of their lives. For instance, commercially important fish and shellfish, including shrimp, blue crab, oysters, salmon, trout, and sea trout rely on, or are associated with, wetlands. Wetlands are also critical habitat for migratory birds and waterfowl, including ducks, egrets, and geese. In fact, more than one-third of the species listed as threatened or endangered in the United States live solely in wetlands and nearly half use wetlands at some point in their lives. As such, many wetlands are often recognized as important conservation or restoration targets.\nWhile covering only six percent of the Earth\u2019s surface, wetlands provide a disproportionately high number of ecosystem services, in addition to maintaining biodiversity. For instance, wetlands also mitigate floods, protect coastal areas from storms, improve water quality, recharge groundwater aquifers, serve as sinks, sources, or transformers of materials, and produce food and goods for human use. When evaluating the economic value of these various functions, scientists concluded that the economic value provided by wetland ecosystems exceeded that provided by lakes, streams, forests, and grasslands and was second only to that provided by coastal estuaries.\nWith mitigation, wetlands are created, restored, or enhanced to replace wetland loss due to development. The Ramsar Convention, an international treaty aimed at conserving wetlands, requires member countries to develop national wetland policies, to establish wetland reserves, and to designate one or more wetlands as an area of international importance. All these efforts are designed to protect or conserve wetlands and the ecosystem services they provide.\nIn coastal wetlands, tidal influence drives the movement and distribution of water and can range from permanent flooding in subtidal wetlands to less frequent flooding in others, with changes in water level occurring daily or semi-daily. Inland wetlands, which lack daily tidal influences, can also be permanently flooded on one extreme or intermittently flooded on the other extreme, with fluctuations over time often occurring seasonally. It is the balance of water inflows and outflows, or the water budget, as well as the geomorphology and soils that, determine the timing, duration, and patterns of flooding in a wetland.",

        "There is something intrinsically fascinating about the idea of evolution. What principles govern the evolution of a species? And what does evolution tell us about the place of Homosapiens in the grand order of things? The writer George Bernard Shaw held that a mystical guiding force impels life to evolve toward eventual perfection. Modern scientists may not believe in this guiding force or in the possibility of perfection, but many would agree that life has been improving itself through evolution for billions of years. (Note that this conveniently makes Homosapiens, a very recent product of evolution, one of the newest and most improved versions of life.) In the view of these scientists, constant competition among species is the engine that drives the process of evolution and people\u2019s life upward.\nTo Darwin, nature was a surface covered with thousands of sharp wedges, all packed by together and jostling for the same space. Those wedges that fared best moved toward the center of the surface, improving their position by knocking other wedges away with violent blows. The standard example that textbooks give of such competitive wedging is the interaction between the brachiopods and the clams. Clams were long held to be ancient undersea competitors of brachiopods due to the fact that the two species inhabited the same ecological niche. Clams are abundant today, whereas brachiopods (dominant in ancient times) are not. Modern clams are also physiologically more complex than brachiopods are. The standard interpretation of these facts is that the clams\u2019 physiology was an evolutionary improvement that gave them the ability to \u201cknock away\u201d the brachiopods.\nIn recent years, however, the prominent naturalists Stephen Jay Gould and C. Brad Calloway have challenged the validity of this example as well as the model it was meant to support. Gould and Calloway found that over most geological time clams and brachiopods went their separate ways. Never did the population of brachiopods dip as that of the clams rose, or vice versa. In fact, the two populations often grew simultaneously, which belies the notion that they were fighting fiercely over the same narrow turf and resources. That there are so many more clams than brachiopods today seems rather to be a consequence of mass deaths that occurred in the Permian period. Whatever caused the mass deaths-some scientists theorize that either there were massive ecological or geological changes, or a comet crashed down from the heavens-clams were simply able to weather the storm much better than brachiopods.\nOut of these observations, Gould and Calloway drew a number of far-reaching conclusions. For instance, they suggested that direct competition between species was far less frequent than Darwin thought. Perhaps nature was really a very large surface on which there were very few wedges, and the wedges consequently did not bang incessantly against each other. Perhaps the problem facing these wedges was rather that the surface continually altered its shape, and they had to struggle independently to stay in a good position on the surface as it changed.\nSo where does that leave Homosapiens if evolution is a response to sudden, unpredictable and sweeping changes in the environment rather than the result of a perpetual struggle? No longer are we the kings of the mountain who clawed our way to the top by advancing beyond other species. We are instead those who looked to the mountains when floods began to rage below and then discovered that living high up has its definite advantages, so long as our mountain doesn\u2019t decide to turn into a volcano.",

        "The economy may be troubled, but one area is thriving: social media. They begin with Facebook and extend through a dizzying array of companies that barely existed five years ago: Twitter, LinkedIn, Groupon, Yammer-and the list goes on. These companies are mostly private, but have attracted the ardent attention of Wall Street and investors, with Facebook now worth purportedly US$75 billion and Groupon valued at close to US $25 billion.\nThere can be little doubt that these companies enrich their founders as well as some investors. But do they add anything to overall economic activity? While jobs in social media jobs are growing fast, there were only about 21,000 listings last spring, a tiny fraction of the 150 million-member U.S. workforce. So do social-media tools enhance productivity or help us bridge the wealth divide? Or are they simply entertaining socially, and diverting us when it comes to national economic health?\nThe answers are vital, because billions of dollars in investment capital are being spent on these ventures, and if we are to have a productive future economy, that capital needs to grow the economic pie-and not just among the elite of Silicon Valley and Wall Street.\nThe problem is that these tools are so new that it is extremely difficult to answer the questions definitively. Flash back nearly 20 years and the same question was being asked about the first Internet wave. Were Netscape and the Web enhancing our economy, or were people just spending more time at work checking out ESPN.com? Official statistics weren\u2019t designed to capture the benefits, and didn\u2019t capture them until statistics experts at the Federal Reserve, urged on by Alan Greenspan, refined the way they measured productivity. As a result of these somewhat controversial innovations, the late 1990s became a period of substantial technology-driven gains.\nIt is possible that the same gap exists today, that social-media tools are indeed laying the groundwork for new industries and jobs, but aren\u2019t yet registering on the statistical radar. Many companies believe social media make them more competitive. Ford and Zappos, for instance, use Twitter to market their products and address consumer complaints.\nOne big question is what proportion of that benefit will be captured economically by consumers vs. corporations. Sure, social media allow people to compare prices and quality and assess which companies are good to work for and where jobs might be. They also may enhance education and idea sharing, but the caveat is that the people who use these tools are the ones with higher education and income to spend on technology, not the tens of millions whose position in today\u2019s world has eroded so sharply. According to a recent Pew Foundation study, only 45 percent of adults making less than US$30,000 have access to broadband, which is an essential component of using content-rich social media effectively.\nAnd that is the rub. Like so many things these days, social media contribute to economic bifurcation. Dynamic companies are benefiting from these tools, even if the gains are tough to nail down in specific figures. Many individuals are benefiting too, using LinkedIn to find jobs and Groupon to find deals. But now, the irony is that social media widen the social divide, making it even harder for the have-nots to navigate.

        "There is something intrinsically fascinating about the idea of evolution. What principles govern the evolution of a species? And what does evolution tell us about the place of Homosapiens in the grand order of things? The writer George Bernard Shaw held that a mystical guiding force impels life to evolve toward eventual perfection. Modern scientists may not believe in this guiding force or in the possibility of perfection, but many would agree that life has been improving itself through evolution for billions of years. (Note that this conveniently makes Homosapiens, a very recent product of evolution, one of the newest and most improved versions of life.) In the view of these scientists, constant competition among species is the engine that drives the process of evolution and people\u2019s life upward.\nTo Darwin, nature was a surface covered with thousands of sharp wedges, all packed by together and jostling for the same space. Those wedges that fared best moved toward the center of the surface, improving their position by knocking other wedges away with violent blows. The standard example that textbooks give of such competitive wedging is the interaction between the brachiopods and the clams. Clams were long held to be ancient undersea competitors of brachiopods due to the fact that the two species inhabited the same ecological niche. Clams are abundant today, whereas brachiopods (dominant in ancient times) are not. Modern clams are also physiologically more complex than brachiopods are. The standard interpretation of these facts is that the clams\u2019 physiology was an evolutionary improvement that gave them the ability to \u201cknock away\u201d the brachiopods.\nIn recent years, however, the prominent naturalists Stephen Jay Gould and C. Brad Calloway have challenged the validity of this example as well as the model it was meant to support. Gould and Calloway found that over most geological time clams and brachiopods went their separate ways. Never did the population of brachiopods dip as that of the clams rose, or vice versa. In fact, the two populations often grew simultaneously, which belies the notion that they were fighting fiercely over the same narrow turf and resources. That there are so many more clams than brachiopods today seems rather to be a consequence of mass deaths that occurred in the Permian period. Whatever caused the mass deaths-some scientists theorize that either there were massive ecological or geological changes, or a comet crashed down from the heavens-clams were simply able to weather the storm much better than brachiopods.\nOut of these observations, Gould and Calloway drew a number of far-reaching conclusions. For instance, they suggested that direct competition between species was far less frequent than Darwin thought. Perhaps nature was really a very large surface on which there were very few wedges, and the wedges consequently did not bang incessantly against each other. Perhaps the problem facing these wedges was rather that the surface continually altered its shape, and they had to struggle independently to stay in a good position on the surface as it changed.\nSo where does that leave Homosapiens if evolution is a response to sudden, unpredictable and sweeping changes in the environment rather than the result of a perpetual struggle? No longer are we the kings of the mountain who clawed our way to the top by advancing beyond other species. We are instead those who looked to the mountains when floods began to rage below and then discovered that living high up has its definite advantages, so long as our mountain doesn\u2019t decide to turn into a volcano.",

Like so many things these days, social media contribute to economic bifurcation. Dynamic companies are benefiting from these tools, even if the gains are tough to nail down in specific figures. Many individuals are benefiting too, using LinkedIn to find jobs and Groupon to find deals. But now, the irony is that social media widen the social divide, making it even harder for the have-nots to navigate. They allow those with jobs to do them more effectively and companies that are profiting to profit more. But so far, they have done little to aid those who are being left behind. They are, in short, business as usual.",

        "There is something intrinsically fascinating about the idea of evolution. What principles govern the evolution of a species? And what does evolution tell us about the place of Homosapiens in the grand order of things? The writer George Bernard Shaw held that a mystical guiding force impels life to evolve toward eventual perfection. Modern scientists may not believe in this guiding force or in the possibility of perfection, but many would agree that life has been improving itself through evolution for billions of years. (Note that this conveniently makes Homosapiens, a very recent product of evolution, one of the newest and most improved versions of life.) In the view of these scientists, constant competition among species is the engine that drives the process of evolution and people\u2019s life upward.\nTo Darwin, nature was a surface covered with thousands of sharp wedges, all packed by together and jostling for the same space. Those wedges that fared best moved toward the center of the surface, improving their position by knocking other wedges away with violent blows. The standard example that textbooks give of such competitive wedging is the interaction between the brachiopods and the clams. Clams were long held to be ancient undersea competitors of brachiopods due to the fact that the two species inhabited the same ecological niche. Clams are abundant today, whereas brachiopods (dominant in ancient times) are not. Modern clams are also physiologically more complex than brachiopods are. The standard interpretation of these facts is that the clams\u2019 physiology was an evolutionary improvement that gave them the ability to \u201cknock away\u201d the brachiopods.\nIn recent years, however, the prominent naturalists Stephen Jay Gould and C. Brad Calloway have challenged the validity of this example as well as the model it was meant to support. Gould and Calloway found that over most geological time clams and brachiopods went their separate ways. Never did the population of brachiopods dip as that of the clams rose, or vice versa. In fact, the two populations often grew simultaneously, which belies the notion that they were fighting fiercely over the same narrow turf and resources. That there are so many more clams than brachiopods today seems rather to be a consequence of mass deaths that occurred in the Permian period. Whatever caused the mass deaths-some scientists theorize that either there were massive ecological or geological changes, or a comet crashed down from the heavens-clams were simply able to weather the storm much better than brachiopods.\nOut of these observations, Gould and Calloway drew a number of far-reaching conclusions. For instance, they suggested that direct competition between species was far less frequent than Darwin thought. Perhaps nature was really a very large surface on which there were very few wedges, and the wedges consequently did not bang incessantly against each other. Perhaps the problem facing these wedges was rather that the surface continually altered its shape, and they had to struggle independently to stay in a good position on the surface as it changed.\nSo where does that leave Homosapiens if evolution is a response to sudden, unpredictable and sweeping changes in the environment rather than the result of a perpetual struggle? No longer are we the kings of the mountain who clawed our way to the top by advancing beyond other species.

        "When the first of the two Viking landers touched down on Mars on July 20, 1976, and began to send camera images back to earth, the scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory could not suppress a certain nervous anticipation, like people holding a lottery ticket that they have a one-in-a-million chance of winning. The first photographs that arrived, however, did not contain any evidence of life. What revealed itself to them was merely a barren landscape littered with rocks and boulders. The view resembled nothing so much as a flat section of desert.\nThe scientists were soon ready to turn their attention from visible life to microorganisms. The twin Viking landers carried three experiments designed to detect current biological activity and one to detect organic compounds, because researchers thought it possible that life had developed on early Mars just as it is thought to have developed on earth, through the gradual chemical evolution of complex organic molecules. To detect biological activity, Martian soil samples were treated with various nutrients that would produce characteristic by-products if life forms were active in the soil. The results from all three experiments were inconclusive. The fourth experiment heated a soil sample to look for signs of organic material, but found none, an unexpected result because at least organic compounds from the bombardment of the Martian surface by meteorites were thought to have been present.\nThe absence of organic materials, some scientists speculated, was the result of intense ultraviolet radiation penetrating the atmosphere of Mars and destroying organic compounds in the soil. Although Mars\u2019 atmosphere was, at one time, rich in carbon dioxide and thus thick enough to protect its surface from the harmful rays of the sun, the carbon dioxide had gradually left the atmosphere and been converted into rocks. This means that even if life had gotten a start on early Mars, it could not have survived the exposure to ultraviolet radiation when the atmosphere thinned.\nDespite the disappointing Viking results, there are those who still keep the possibility of life on Mars open. They point out that the Viking data cannot be considered the final word on Martian life because the two landers only sampled two limited-and uninteresting-sites. The Viking landing sites were not chosen for what they might tell of the planet\u2019s biology. They were chosen primarily because they appeared to be safe for landing a spacecraft. The landing sites were on parts of the Martian plains that appeared relatively featureless from orbital photographs.\nThe type of Martian terrain that these researchers suggest may be a possible hiding place because active life has an earthly parallel: the ice-free region of southern Victoria Land, Antarctica, where the temperatures in some dry valleys average below zero. Organisms known as endoliths, a form of blue-green algae that has adapted to this harsh environment, were found living inside certain rocks in these Antarctic valleys. The argument based on this discovery is that if life did exist on early Mars, it is possible that it escaped worsening conditions by similarly seeking refuge in rocks. Skeptics object, however, that Mars in its present state is simply too dry, even compared with Antarctic valleys, to sustain any life whatsoever.\nShould Mars eventually prove to be completely barren of life, as some suspect, then this would have a significant impact on the current view of the chemical origin of life. It could be much more difficult to get life started on a planet than scientists thought before the Viking landings.",

        "There is something intrinsically fascinating about the idea of evolution. What principles govern the evolution of a species? And what does evolution tell us about the place of Homosapiens in the grand order of things? The writer George Bernard Shaw held that a mystical guiding force impels life to evolve toward eventual perfection. Modern scientists may not believe in this guiding force or in the possibility of perfection, but many would agree that life has been improving itself through evolution for billions of years. (Note that this conveniently makes Homosapiens, a very recent product of evolution, one of the newest and most improved versions of life.) In the view of these scientists, constant competition among species is the engine that drives the process of evolution and people\u2019s life upward.\nTo Darwin, nature was a surface covered with thousands of sharp wedges, all packed by together and jostling for the same space. Those wedges that fared best moved toward the center of the surface, improving their position by knocking other wedges away with violent blows. The standard example that textbooks give of such competitive wedging is the interaction between the brachiopods and the clams. Clams were long held to be ancient undersea competitors of brachiopods due to the fact that the two species inhabited the same ecological niche. Clams are abundant today, whereas brachiopods (dominant in ancient times) are not. Modern clams are also physiologically more complex than brachiopods are. The standard interpretation of these facts is that the clams\u2019 physiology was an evolutionary improvement that gave them the ability to \u201cknock away\u201d the brachiopods.\nIn recent years, however, the prominent naturalists Stephen Jay Gould and C. Brad Calloway have challenged the validity of this example as well as the model it was meant to support. Gould and Calloway found that over most geological time clams and brachiopods went their separate ways. Never did the population of brachiopods dip as that of the clams rose, or vice versa. In fact, the two populations often grew simultaneously, which belies the notion that they were fighting fiercely over the same narrow turf and resources. That there are so many more clams than brachiopods today seems rather to be a consequence of mass deaths that occurred in the Permian period. Whatever caused the mass deaths-some scientists theorize that either there were massive ecological or geological changes, or a comet crashed down from the heavens-clams were simply able to weather the storm much better than brachiopods.\nOut of these observations, Gould and Calloway drew a number of far-reaching conclusions. For instance, they suggested that direct competition between species was far less frequent than Darwin thought. Perhaps nature was really a very large surface on which there were very few wedges, and the wedges consequently did not bang incessantly against each other. Perhaps the problem facing these wedges was rather that the surface continually altered its shape, and they had to struggle independently to stay in a good position on the surface as it changed.\nSo where does that leave Homosapiens if evolution is a response to sudden, unpredictable and sweeping changes in the environment rather than the result of a perpetual struggle? No longer are we the kings of the mountain who clawed our way to the top by advancing beyond other species. We are instead those who looked to the mountains when floods began to rage below and then discovered that living high up has its definite advantages, so long as our mountain doesn\u2019t decide to turn into a volcano.",

        "Embracing failure is a clich\u00e9 of the business world. But as Matthew Syed, a journalist at The Times, shows in a new book, Black Box Thinking, in practice a \u201cstigmatizing attitude toward error\u201d pervades everyday life. This has big implications.\nSuccess brings its own rewards, but the world comes down hard on those who are deemed failures. The desire to avoid such opprobrium prompts people to cover up mistakes, argues Mr. Syed. Police fail to drop cases against people accused of committing a crime, even after clear evidence emerges of their innocence. Politicians plough on with policies even when it is obvious they are not working. All are psychological strategies to avoid admitting go fault.\nFear of failure can have devastating consequences, as MAr. Syed shows in a story about United Airlines. In 1978, as a plane approached its destination, the pilot worried that the landing gear had not come down. Desperate, he tried to establish what was wrong, becoming blinded to the plane\u2019s dwindling fuel reserves. Eventually the tank was empty, and the plane crashed. The worry of making a mistake-subjecting the passengers to a bumpy landing-blinded him to bigger problems.\nThe story is a metaphor. Investors hold on to losing stocks longer than they should. Unable to face the shame of a bad return, they end up with a much bigger loss. Fred Goodwin of RBS, a bank, fretted about the color of the carpets at head office while his firm collapsed under the weight of the financial crisis. The medical profession is especially intolerant of mishaps, says Mr. Syed. This means that mistakes are not scrutinized and people do not learn from them. Small wonder that blunders are pervasive. According to one study of acute care in hospitals, one in 10 patients \u201cis killed or injured as a consequence of medical error or institutional shortcomings\u201d.\nWhat to do? One solution is making it easy for people to own up or speak up, as the airline industry has learned to do better than any other. Mr. Syed\u2019s more novel suggestion, though, is the rigorous testing of business strategies. This forces people to make improvements. The gold standard is the \u201crandomized control trial\u201d (RCT), in which a treatment group is compared with a control group. Capital One, a credit-card company, has used RCTs obsessively-over the fonts it uses, for example, and the scripts at its call- centers-to assess which initiatives fail and which do not. James Dyson, a technology entrepreneur, and Google are other cheerleaders for this hyperrational school of management.\nThis approach may also hold benefits for governments. David Halpern is the boss of the British government\u2019s Behavioral Insights Team (BIT), known as the \u201cnudge unit,\u201d which uses RCTs to improve policy.\nIdentifying points of failure and making small changes, he argues, reaps disproportionate gains. By including a message on a car-tax form appealing to people\u2019s sense of humanity, the BIT sharply boosted organ donations.\nMuch still needs to be done. Between 2010 and 2012 the BIT saved the British government only \u00a3300 million ($457 million), a negligible proportion of GDP. Few businesses incorporate RCTs as extensively as Capital One. Much more could be done. Hospitals could subject doctors to RCTs, identify the mistake-prone and then help them. Civil servants could randomly test the economic impact of policies, such as changes to income tax, before rolling them out. It sounds extreme, but confronting failure rationally would bring huge rewards.",

        "Embracing failure is a clich\u00e9 of the business world. But as Matthew Syed, a journalist at The Times, shows in a new book, Black Box Thinking, in practice a \u201cstigmatizing attitude toward error\u201d pervades everyday life. This has big implications.\nSuccess brings its own rewards, but the world comes down hard on those who are deemed failures. The desire to avoid such opprobrium prompts people to cover up mistakes, argues Mr. Syed. Police fail to drop cases against people accused of committing a crime, even after clear evidence emerges of their innocence. Politicians plough on with policies even when it is obvious they are not working. All are psychological strategies to avoid admitting go fault.\nFear of failure can have devastating consequences, as MAr. Syed shows in a story about United Airlines. In 1978, as a plane approached its destination, the pilot worried that the landing gear had not come down. Desperate, he tried to establish what was wrong, becoming blinded to the plane\u2019s dwindling fuel reserves. Eventually the tank was empty, and the plane crashed. The worry of making a mistake-subjecting the passengers to a bumpy landing-blinded him to bigger problems.\nThe story is a metaphor. Investors hold on to losing stocks longer than they should. Unable to face the shame of a bad return, they end up with a much bigger loss. Fred Goodwin of RBS, a bank, fretted about the color of the carpets at head office while his firm collapsed under the weight of the financial crisis. The medical profession is especially intolerant of mishaps, says Mr. Syed. This means that mistakes are not scrutinized and people do not learn from them. Small wonder that blunders are pervasive. According to one study of acute care in hospitals, one in 10 patients \u201cis killed or injured as a consequence of medical error or institutional shortcomings\u201d.\nWhat to do? One solution is making it easy for people to own up or speak up, as the airline industry has learned to do better than any other. Mr. Syed\u2019s more novel suggestion, though, is the rigorous testing of business strategies. This forces people to make improvements. The gold standard is the \u201crandomized control trial\u201d (RCT), in which a treatment group is compared with a control group. Capital One, a credit-card company, has used RCTs obsessively-over the fonts it uses, for example, and the scripts at its call- centers-to assess which initiatives fail and which do not. James Dyson, a technology entrepreneur, and Google are other cheerleaders for this hyperrational school of management.\nThis approach may also hold benefits for governments. David Halpern is the boss of the British government\u2019s Behavioral Insights Team (BIT), known as the \u201cnudge unit,\u201d which uses RCTs to improve policy.\nIdentifying points of failure and making small changes, he argues, reaps disproportionate gains. By including a message on a car-tax form appealing to people\u2019s sense of humanity, the BIT sharply boosted organ donations.\nMuch still needs to be done. Between 2010 and 2012 the BIT saved the British government only \u00a3300 million ($457 million), a negligible proportion of GDP. Few businesses incorporate RCTs as extensively as Capital One. Much more could be done. Hospitals could subject doctors to RCTs, identify the mistake-prone and then help them. Civil servants could randomly test the economic impact of policies, such as changes to income tax, before rolling them out. It sounds extreme, but confronting failure rationally would bring huge rewards.",

        "For more than 50 years, microbiologists in the U. S. and Europe have warned against using antibiotics to fatten up farm animals. The practice, they argue, threatens human health by turning farms into breeding grounds of drug-resistant bacteria. Farmers responded that restricting antibiotics in livestock would devastate the industry and significantly raise costs to consumers. We have empirical data that should resolve this debate. Since1995, Denmark has enforced progressively tighter rules on the use of antibiotics in raising pigs, poultry and other livestock. In the process, it has shown that it\u2019s possible to protect human health without hurting farmers.\nFarmers in many countries use antibiotics in two key ways: (1) at full strength to treat sick animals and (2) in low doses to fatten meat-producing livestock or to prevent veterinary illnesses. Although even the proper use of antibiotics can inadvertently lead to the spread of drug-resistant bacteria, the habit of using a low or \u201csub-therapeutic\u201d dose is a formula for disaster: the treatment provides just enough antibiotic to kill some but not all bacteria. The germs that survive are typically those that happen to bear genetic mutations for resisting the antibiotic. They then reproduce and exchange genes with other microbial resisters. Because bacteria are found literally everywhere, resistant strains produced in animals eventually find their way into people as well. You could hardly design a better system for guaranteeing the spread of antibiotic resistance.\nThe data from multiple studies over the years support the conclusion that low doses of antibiotics in animals increase the number of drug-resistant microbesin both animals and people. As Joshua M. Scharfstein, a principal deputy commissioner at the Food and Drug Administration, put it, \u201cYou actually can trace the specific bacteria around and ... find that the resistant strains in humans match the resistant strains in the animals.\u201d And this science is what led Denmark to stop sub-therapeutic dosing of chickens, pigs and other farm animals.\nAlthough the transition unfolded smoothly in the poultry industry, the average weight of pigs fell in the first year. But after Danish farmers started leaving piglets together with their mothers a few weeks longer to bolster their immune systems naturally, the animals\u2019 weights jumped back up, and the number of pigs per litter increased as well. The lesson is that improving animal husbandry - making sure that stalls and cages are properly cleaned and giving animals more room or time to mature - offsets the initial negative impact of limiting antibiotic use. Today Danish industry reports that productivity is higher than before. Meanwhile, reports of antibiotic resistance in Danish people are mixed, which shows-as if we needed reminding-that there are no quick fixes.\nOf course, the way veterinary antibiotics are used is not the only cause of human drug- resistant infections. Careless use of the drugs in people also contributes to the problem. But agricultural use is still a major contributing factor. Every day brings new evidence that we are in danger of losing effective antibiotic protection against many of the most dangerous bacteria that cause human illness. The technical issues are solvable.

        "For more than 50 years, microbiologists in the U. S. and Europe have warned against using antibiotics to fatten up farm animals. The practice, they argue, threatens human health by turning farms into breeding grounds of drug-resistant bacteria. Farmers responded that restricting antibiotics in livestock would devastate the industry and significantly raise costs to consumers. We have empirical data that should resolve this debate. Since1995, Denmark has enforced progressively tighter rules on the use of antibiotics in raising pigs, poultry and other livestock. In the process, it has shown that it\u2019s possible to protect human health without hurting farmers.\nFarmers in many countries use antibiotics in two key ways: (1) at full strength to treat sick animals and (2) in low doses to fatten meat-producing livestock or to prevent veterinary illnesses. Although even the proper use of antibiotics can inadvertently lead to the spread of drug-resistant bacteria, the habit of using a low or \u201csub-therapeutic\u201d dose is a formula for disaster: the treatment provides just enough antibiotic to kill some but not all bacteria. The germs that survive are typically those that happen to bear genetic mutations for resisting the antibiotic. They then reproduce and exchange genes with other microbial resisters. Because bacteria are found literally everywhere, resistant strains produced in animals eventually find their way into people as well. You could hardly design a better system for guaranteeing the spread of antibiotic resistance.\nThe data from multiple studies over the years support the conclusion that low doses of antibiotics in animals increase the number of drug-resistant microbesin both animals and people. As Joshua M. Scharfstein, a principal deputy commissioner at the Food and Drug Administration, put it, \u201cYou actually can trace the specific bacteria around and ... find that the resistant strains in humans match the resistant strains in the animals.\u201d And this science is what led Denmark to stop sub-therapeutic dosing of chickens, pigs and other farm animals.\nAlthough the transition unfolded smoothly in the poultry industry, the average weight of pigs fell in the first year.

        "Embracing failure is a clich\u00e9 of the business world. But as Matthew Syed, a journalist at The Times, shows in a new book, Black Box Thinking, in practice a \u201cstigmatizing attitude toward error\u201d pervades everyday life. This has big implications.\nSuccess brings its own rewards, but the world comes down hard on those who are deemed failures. The desire to avoid such opprobrium prompts people to cover up mistakes, argues Mr. Syed. Police fail to drop cases against people accused of committing a crime, even after clear evidence emerges of their innocence. Politicians plough on with policies even when it is obvious they are not working. All are psychological strategies to avoid admitting go fault.\nFear of failure can have devastating consequences, as MAr. Syed shows in a story about United Airlines. In 1978, as a plane approached its destination, the pilot worried that the landing gear had not come down. Desperate, he tried to establish what was wrong, becoming blinded to the plane\u2019s dwindling fuel reserves. Eventually the tank was empty, and the plane crashed. The worry of making a mistake-subjecting the passengers to a bumpy landing-blinded him to bigger problems.\nThe story is a metaphor. Investors hold on to losing stocks longer than they should. Unable to face the shame of a bad return, they end up with a much bigger loss. Fred Goodwin of RBS, a bank, fretted about the color of the carpets at head office while his firm collapsed under the weight of the financial crisis. The medical profession is especially intolerant of mishaps, says Mr. Syed. This means that mistakes are not scrutinized and people do not learn from them. Small wonder that blunders are pervasive. According to one study of acute care in hospitals, one in 10 patients \u201cis killed or injured as a consequence of medical error or institutional shortcomings\u201d.\nWhat to do? One solution is making it easy for people to own up or speak up, as the airline industry has learned to do better than any other. Mr. Syed\u2019s more novel suggestion, though, is the rigorous testing of business strategies. This forces people to make improvements. The gold standard is the \u201crandomized control trial\u201d (RCT), in which a treatment group is compared with a control group. Capital One, a credit-card company, has used RCTs obsessively-over the fonts it uses, for example, and the scripts at its call- centers-to assess which initiatives fail and which do not. James Dyson, a technology entrepreneur, and Google are other cheerleaders for this hyperrational school of management.\nThis approach may also hold benefits for governments. David Halpern is the boss of the British government\u2019s Behavioral Insights Team (BIT), known as the \u201cnudge unit,\u201d which uses RCTs to improve policy.\nIdentifying points of failure and making small changes, he argues, reaps disproportionate gains. By including a message on a car-tax form appealing to people\u2019s sense of humanity, the BIT sharply boosted organ donations.\nMuch still needs to be done. Between 2010 and 2012 the BIT saved the British government only \u00a3300 million ($457 million), a negligible proportion of GDP. Few businesses incorporate RCTs as extensively as Capital One.

        "With cloud, mobility, big data and consumerization, companies are in even greater need of technology talent than they were in the late 1990s, and that talent is in even shorter supply. Computer science enrollments are at an all-time low; baby-boomer workers are retiring and taking all of that legacy-systems knowledge with them; and Silicon Valley is hot again. Would that young, brilliant developer rather join the next Zynga or upgrade the payroll systems at your insurance company?\nTwo weeks ago, I asked the IT executive readership of my weekly newsletter, The Heller Report, to answer the question: If you had a magic wand, which one talent problem would you solve? Responses poured in and addressed challenges around recruiting, developing leaders, and retaining the talent that they currently have. But more than 70 percent of readers would use their magic wand to do only one thing: give business skills to their technologists. Their people, they worry, are so narrowly focused on the technology that they fail to see the forest for the trees. They do not understand the business context of their technology work, nor can they have meaningful discussions with the leaders of the business areas about their technology support.\nThis lack of business-savvy technology talent is a serious problem for every company that relies on technology to exist (which is, of course, every company). Those beautifully \u201cblended executives,\u201d who can talk technology in one meeting and can talk business in another, are rare birds. Yet with technology moving directly into the revenue stream of your company, you need them, and your need is only going to increase.\nOne option is to spend all of your time and money on recruiting blended executives from the outside. You will be in heated competition with every other company in your market, and if your recruiting function is not a competitive weapon for you, you will find yourself in a losing battle. You would be much better off growing your own. Here are some ideas:\nBuild a rotational program. Encourage your head of human resources to work with your CIO and a few of your other business leaders to build a program that rotates IT people into different functions of the business. This kind of program is not easy, with your CIO having to survive without a trusted IT leader for a period of timne, but the long-term result of a good rotational program can be tremendous. It may well be worth the investment.\nInvolve your business leaders. If a rotational program is too much to take on right now, build a leadership development program for IT that involves your business executives. Encourage your CIO to invite the heads of your major business units to meet regularly with the senior IT team to educate them on their business area. And be sure that you, CFO, are spending enough time with IT. Use that interaction to chip away at the long-standing wall that often exists between the business and IT.\nEmbed your IT people in the business. By now, your CIO should have restructured the IT organization so that each major business or functional area has a dedicated IT leader. These positions are called \u201cbusiness relationship executives,\u201d portfolio CIOs, or customer relationship managers, and they often report both to the CIO and to a functional or P&L leader. The more time they spend in \u201cthe business,\u201d the more they learn skills beyond IT, and the more valuable they become to you over time. You know you are on the right track when you walk into a business unit meeting, and from the dialogue taking place, you cannot easily distinguish the IT person from everyone else.",

        "With cloud, mobility, big data and consumerization, companies are in even greater need of technology talent than they were in the late 1990s, and that talent is in even shorter supply. Computer science enrollments are at an all-time low; baby-boomer workers are retiring and taking all of that legacy-systems knowledge with them; and Silicon Valley is hot again. Would that young, brilliant developer rather join the next Zynga or upgrade the payroll systems at your insurance company?\nTwo weeks ago, I asked the IT executive readership of my weekly newsletter, The Heller Report, to answer the question: If you had a magic wand, which one talent problem would you solve? Responses poured in and addressed challenges around recruiting, developing leaders, and retaining the talent that they currently have. But more than 70 percent of readers would use their magic wand to do only one thing: give business skills to their technologists. Their people, they worry, are so narrowly focused on the technology that they fail to see the forest for the trees. They do not understand the business context of their technology work, nor can they have meaningful discussions with the leaders of the business areas about their technology support.\nThis lack of business-savvy technology talent is a serious problem for every company that relies on technology to exist (which is, of course, every company). Those beautifully \u201cblended executives,\u201d who can talk technology in one meeting and can talk business in another, are rare birds. Yet with technology moving directly into the revenue stream of your company, you need them, and your need is only going to increase.\nOne option is to spend all of your time and money on recruiting blended executives from the outside. You will be in heated competition with every other company in your market, and if your recruiting function is not a competitive weapon for you, you will find yourself in a losing battle. You would be much better off growing your own. Here are some ideas:\nBuild a rotational program. Encourage your head of human resources to work with your CIO and a few of your other business leaders to build a program that rotates IT people into different functions of the business. This kind of program is not easy, with your CIO having to survive without a trusted IT leader for a period of timne, but the long-term result of a good rotational program can be tremendous. It may well be worth the investment.\nInvolve your business leaders. If a rotational program is too much to take on right now, build a leadership development program for IT that involves your business executives. Encourage your CIO to invite the heads of your major business units to meet regularly with the senior IT team to educate them on their business area. And be sure that you, CFO, are spending enough time with IT. Use that interaction to chip away at the long-standing wall that often exists between the business and IT.\nEmbed your IT people in the business. By now, your CIO should have restructured the IT organization so that each major business or functional area has a dedicated IT leader. These positions are called \u201cbusiness relationship executives,\u201d portfolio CIOs, or customer relationship managers, and they often report both to the CIO and to a functional or P&L leader. The more time they spend in \u201cthe business,\u201d the more they learn skills beyond IT, and the more valuable they become to you over time. You know you are on the right track when you walk into a business unit meeting, and from the dialogue taking place, you cannot easily distinguish the IT person from everyone else.",

        "Declining house prices, rising job layoffs, skyrocketing oil costs and a major credit crunch have brought consumer confidence to its lowest point in five years. With a relatively long recession looking increasingly likely, many American families may be planning to tighten their belts.\nInterestingly, restraining our consumer spending, in the short term, may cause us to actually loosen the belts around our waists. What\u2019s the connection? The brain has a limited capacity for self-regulation, so exerting willpower in one area often leads to backsliding in others. The good news, however, is that practice increases willpower capacity, so that in the long run, buying less now may improve our ability to achieve future goals-like losing those 10 pounds we gained when we weren\u2019t out shopping.\nThe brain\u2019s store of willpower is depleted when people control their thoughts, feelings or impulses, or when they modify their behaviors in pursuit of goals. Psychologist Roy Baumeister and others have found that people who successfully accomplish one task requiring self-control are less persistent on a second, seemingly unrelated task.\nIn one pioneering study, some people were asked to eat radishes while others received freshly baked chocolate chip cookies before trying to solve an impossible puzzle. The radish-eaters abandoned the puzzle in eight minutes on average, working less than half as long as people who got cookies or those who were excused from eating radishes. Similarly, people who were asked to circle every \u201ce\u201d on a page of text then showed less persistence in watching a video of an unchanging table and wall.\nOther activities that deplete willpower include resisting food or drink, suppressing emotional responses, restraining aggressive or sexual impulses, taking exams and trying to impress someone. Task persistence is also reduced when people are stressed or tired from exertion or lack of sleep.\nWhat limits willpower? Some have suggested that it is blood sugar, which brain cells use as their main energy source and cannot do without for even a few minutes. Most cognitive functions are unaffected by minor blood sugar fluctuations over the course of a day, but planning and self-control are sensitive to such small changes. Exerting self-control lowers blood sugar, which reduces the capacity for further self-control. People who drink a glass of lemonade between completing one task requiring self-control and beginning a second one perform equally well on both tasks, while people who drink sugarless diet lemonade make more errors on the second task than on the first. Foods that persistently elevate blood sugar, like those containing protein or complex carbohydrates, might enhance willpower for longer periods.\nIn the short term, you should spend your limited willpower budget wisely. It can be counterproductive to work toward multiple goals at the same time if your willpower cannot cover all the efforts that are required. Concentrating your effort on one or, at most, a few goals at a time increases the odds of success.\nFocusing on success is important because willpower can grow in the long term. Like a muscle, willpower seems to become stronger with use. The idea of exercising willpower is seen in military boot camp, where recruits are trained to overcome one challenge after another.\nNo one knows why willpower can grow with practice, but consistently doing any activity that requires self-control seems to increase willpower\u2014and the ability to resist impulses and delay gratification is highly associated with success in life.",

Similarly, people who were asked to circle every \u201ce\u201d on a page of text then showed less persistence in watching a video of an unchanging table and wall.\nOther activities that deplete willpower include resisting food or drink, suppressing emotional responses, restraining aggressive or sexual impulses, taking exams and trying to impress someone. Task persistence is also reduced when people are stressed or tired from exertion or lack of sleep.\nWhat limits willpower? Some have suggested that it is blood sugar, which brain cells use as their main energy source and cannot do without for even a few minutes. Most cognitive functions are unaffected by minor blood sugar fluctuations over the course of a day, but planning and self-control are sensitive to such small changes. Exerting self-control lowers blood sugar, which reduces the capacity for further self-control. People who drink a glass of lemonade between completing one task requiring self-control and beginning a second one perform equally well on both tasks, while people who drink sugarless diet lemonade make more errors on the second task than on the first. Foods that persistently elevate blood sugar, like those containing protein or complex carbohydrates, might enhance willpower for longer periods.\nIn the short term, you should spend your limited willpower budget wisely. It can be counterproductive to work toward multiple goals at the same time if your willpower cannot cover all the efforts that are required. Concentrating your effort on one or, at most, a few goals at a time increases the odds of success.\nFocusing on success is important because willpower can grow in the long term. Like a muscle, willpower seems to become stronger with use. The idea of exercising willpower is seen in military boot camp, where recruits are trained to overcome one challenge after another.\nNo one knows why willpower can grow with practice, but consistently doing any activity that requires self-control seems to increase willpower\u2014and the ability to resist impulses and delay gratification is highly associated with success in life.",

        "With cloud, mobility, big data and consumerization, companies are in even greater need of technology talent than they were in the late 1990s, and that talent is in even shorter supply. Computer science enrollments are at an all-time low; baby-boomer workers are retiring and taking all of that legacy-systems knowledge with them; and Silicon Valley is hot again. Would that young, brilliant developer rather join the next Zynga or upgrade the payroll systems at your insurance company?\nTwo weeks ago, I asked the IT executive readership of my weekly newsletter, The Heller Report, to answer the question: If you had a magic wand, which one talent problem would you solve? Responses poured in and addressed challenges around recruiting, developing leaders, and retaining the talent that they currently have. But more than 70 percent of readers would use their magic wand to do only one thing: give business skills to their technologists. Their people, they worry, are so narrowly focused on the technology that they fail to see the forest for the trees. They do not understand the business context of their technology work, nor can they have meaningful discussions with the leaders of the business areas about their technology support.\nThis lack of business-savvy technology talent is a serious problem for every company that relies on technology to exist (which is, of course, every company). Those beautifully \u201cblended executives,\u201d who can talk technology in one meeting and can talk business in another, are rare birds. Yet with technology moving directly into the revenue stream of your company, you need them, and your need is only going to increase.\nOne option is to spend all of your time and money on recruiting blended executives from the outside. You will be in heated competition with every other company in your market, and if your recruiting function is not a competitive weapon for you, you will find yourself in a losing battle. You would be much better off growing your own. Here are some ideas:\nBuild a rotational program. Encourage your head of human resources to work with your CIO and a few of your other business leaders to build a program that rotates IT people into different functions of the business. This kind of program is not easy, with your CIO having to survive without a trusted IT leader for a period of timne, but the long-term result of a good rotational program can be tremendous. It may well be worth the investment.\nInvolve your business leaders. If a rotational program is too much to take on right now, build a leadership development program for IT that involves your business executives. Encourage your CIO to invite the heads of your major business units to meet regularly with the senior IT team to educate them on their business area. And be sure that you, CFO, are spending enough time with IT. Use that interaction to chip away at the long-standing wall that often exists between the business and IT.\nEmbed your IT people in the business. By now, your CIO should have restructured the IT organization so that each major business or functional area has a dedicated IT leader. These positions are called \u201cbusiness relationship executives,\u201d portfolio CIOs, or customer relationship managers, and they often report both to the CIO and to a functional or P&L leader. The more time they spend in \u201cthe business,\u201d the more they learn skills beyond IT, and the more valuable they become to you over time. You know you are on the right track when you walk into a business unit meeting, and from the dialogue taking place, you cannot easily distinguish the IT person from everyone else.",

Similarly, people who were asked to circle every \u201ce\u201d on a page of text then showed less persistence in watching a video of an unchanging table and wall.\nOther activities that deplete willpower include resisting food or drink, suppressing emotional responses, restraining aggressive or sexual impulses, taking exams and trying to impress someone. Task persistence is also reduced when people are stressed or tired from exertion or lack of sleep.\nWhat limits willpower? Some have suggested that it is blood sugar, which brain cells use as their main energy source and cannot do without for even a few minutes. Most cognitive functions are unaffected by minor blood sugar fluctuations over the course of a day, but planning and self-control are sensitive to such small changes. Exerting self-control lowers blood sugar, which reduces the capacity for further self-control. People who drink a glass of lemonade between completing one task requiring self-control and beginning a second one perform equally well on both tasks, while people who drink sugarless diet lemonade make more errors on the second task than on the first. Foods that persistently elevate blood sugar, like those containing protein or complex carbohydrates, might enhance willpower for longer periods.\nIn the short term, you should spend your limited willpower budget wisely. It can be counterproductive to work toward multiple goals at the same time if your willpower cannot cover all the efforts that are required. Concentrating your effort on one or, at most, a few goals at a time increases the odds of success.\nFocusing on success is important because willpower can grow in the long term. Like a muscle, willpower seems to become stronger with use. The idea of exercising willpower is seen in military boot camp, where recruits are trained to overcome one challenge after another.\nNo one knows why willpower can grow with practice, but consistently doing any activity that requires self-control seems to increase willpower\u2014and the ability to resist impulses and delay gratification is highly associated with success in life.",

Would that young, brilliant developer rather join the next Zynga or upgrade the payroll systems at your insurance company?\nTwo weeks ago, I asked the IT executive readership of my weekly newsletter, The Heller Report, to answer the question: If you had a magic wand, which one talent problem would you solve? Responses poured in and addressed challenges around recruiting, developing leaders, and retaining the talent that they currently have. But more than 70 percent of readers would use their magic wand to do only one thing: give business skills to their technologists. Their people, they worry, are so narrowly focused on the technology that they fail to see the forest for the trees. They do not understand the business context of their technology work, nor can they have meaningful discussions with the leaders of the business areas about their technology support.\nThis lack of business-savvy technology talent is a serious problem for every company that relies on technology to exist (which is, of course, every company). Those beautifully \u201cblended executives,\u201d who can talk technology in one meeting and can talk business in another, are rare birds.

You would be much better off growing your own. Here are some ideas:\nBuild a rotational program. Encourage your head of human resources to work with your CIO and a few of your other business leaders to build a program that rotates IT people into different functions of the business. This kind of program is not easy, with your CIO having to survive without a trusted IT leader for a period of timne, but the long-term result of a good rotational program can be tremendous. It may well be worth the investment.\nInvolve your business leaders. If a rotational program is too much to take on right now, build a leadership development program for IT that involves your business executives. Encourage your CIO to invite the heads of your major business units to meet regularly with the senior IT team to educate them on their business area. And be sure that you, CFO, are spending enough time with IT. Use that interaction to chip away at the long-standing wall that often exists between the business and IT.\nEmbed your IT people in the business. By now, your CIO should have restructured the IT organization so that each major business or functional area has a dedicated IT leader.

        "The European online fashion business is fierce. Just ask backers of one-time highfliers. Like boo. com, the urban sportswear retailer that tanked last year, and dressmart. com, the struggling men\u2019s wear specialist. Those once stellar online brands expanded too fast, spent much more than they earned, and then lost their investor support after Internet stocks began plummeting last April. The markets sent online fashion stores a tough message: come up with business models that generate revenues.\n\nA few firms have shown that not all online fashion shops are Internet disasters. \u00a0Copenhagen- based haburi. com, the online designer-label discount store, Sweden\u2019s sportswear vendor Sportus and the Italian shirts store Marco Bracci are doing well in a very tough environment.\n\nHaburi\u2019s distinctive business model is an Internet version of the factory outlet where brand manufacturers sell directly to consumers at lower prices from huge out-of-town shopping malls. A concept used in the U. S. far more than in Europe, and Haburi wants to fill the gap. Michael Vad, Haburi\u2019s CEO, says that Europe\u2019s apparel factory outlet sector could yield $10 billion in sales annually.\n\nAccording to Vad, national regulations that limit malls outside city centers have hampered the development of this sector. \u201cFor the consumer, there is the two-hour drive to the mall, and when you get there, you don\u2019t know whether you will get the size or color you want,\u201d says VaD. By going online, Haburi aims to cut the retailer\u2019s costs, save consumers the long drive, and deliver orders within two or five days. Haburi splits net revenue 50-50 with the brand manufacturers.\n\nApparel is difficult to sell online because people like to feel and touch the clothes they buy. For the online retailer, acquiring the items, inspecting them, cleaning and storing them can be expensive. \u201cThe cost of customer service in the apparel business is much higher than selling books or even furniture,\u201d says Matthew Nordan, a retail analyst at Forester Research\u2019s Amsterdam office.\n\nUnless linked to a major established operation, an online retailer needs a competitive edge. For example, Italian shirt-maker Marco Bracci sells expensive goods for high profits and has cornered a niche market. Dressmart, on the other hand, tried to do too much too soon. Originally it planned to sell only shirts and to make the original Swedish operation profitable before branching out. But within months it tried to go pan-European and sell everything including ties, shoes and sportswear, and to rent physical outlet at airports. Dressmart, on the verge of bankruptcy and searching for a backer, has now scaled back and operates only in Sweden.",

The two techniques do not measure nerve-cell activity directly; they measure the extra flow of blood that surges to the most active brain areas.\n\nResearchers at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, have monitored these changes in blood flow in anesthetized cats by removing parts of the skull and observing how the nerve cells in activated regions fuel their activities by rapidly removing oxygen from nearby red blood cells.\n\nThis rapid uptake of oxygen, made evident by visible changes in the color of the red cells, proves that early oxygen transfer gives these neurons the energy to do their work, the researchers said.\n\nThey also found that subtle changes in blood flow began significantly earlier than was detected by PET and functional M. R. I. scans, which lack sufficient resolution and do not form their images quickly enough to follow such rapid changes. Dr. Amiram Grinvald published the findings in the Journal Science.\n\n\u201cThe initial event is very localized and will be missed if you don\u2019t look for it soon enough and use the highest possible resolution,\u201d Dr. Grinvald said. \u201cNow people are beginning to use our results with other imaging methods. \u201d\n\nWorking on the exposed brain lets researchers follow electrical activity and the accompanying blood flow in greater detail than is possible by using indirect imaging methods that track neural activity through the skull. However, opportunities for open-skull studies of humans are limited to some kinds of neurosurgery, and researchers must mostly rely on PET and functional M. R. I. images for studies linking behavior with specific brain activity.\n\nBy directly observing exposed cat brains and in similar work with a few human cases, Dr. Grinvald and his associates have been able to observe the first evidence of electrical activity and other changes in brain cells after a light has been seen or a limb moved.\n\nThe newest research showed that it took three seconds or more after an event for the flow of blood to increase to an area of the brain dealing with a stimulus. That is the blood-flow increase usually pictured in brain-function studies with PET or functional M. R. I techniques, the Israeli researchers said. However, the initial reaction observed in the Weizmann research by directly imaging the exposed brain-the direct transfer of oxygen from blood ceils to neurons-occurred in the first-tenth of a second and was lost to conventional imaging, they said.\n\nThe later increase in blood flow to the area, Dr. Grinvald said, was obviously an attempt by the body to supply more oxygen for brain activity. But the increase in blood was so abundant that it covered an area much larger than the region directly involved in the activity being studied, masking some of the subtle changes, he said.\n\nThe body\u2019s reaction, the researchers said in the paper, was like \u201cwatering the entire garden for the sake of one thirsty flower. \u201d\n\nDr. Kamil Ugurbil, said that the Israeli research provided clues that allowed the use of functional M.

        "\u201cThe language of a composer\u201d, Cardus wrote, \u201chis harmonies, rhythms, melodies, colors and texture, cannot be separated except bypedantic analysis from the mind and sensibility of the artist who happens to be expressing himself through them\u201d.\n\nBut that is precisely the trouble; for as far as I can see, Mozart\u2019s can. Mozart make me begin to see ghosts, or at the very least ouija-boards. If you read Beethoven\u2019s letters you feel that you are at the heart of a tempest, a whirlwind, a furnace; and so you should, because you are. If you read Wagner\u2019s, you feel that you have been run over by a tank, and that, too, is an appropriate response.\n\nBut if you read Mozart\u2019s -and he was a hugely prolific letter-writer-you have no clue at all to the power that drove him and the music it squeezed out of him in such profusion that death alone could stop it; they reveal nothing-nothing that explains it. Of course it is absurd \uff08though the mistake is frequently made\uff09 to seek external causes for particular works of music; but with Mozart it is also absurd, or at any rate useless, to seek for internal ones either. Mozart was an instrument. But who was playing it?\n\nThat is what I mean by the Mozart Problem and the anxiety it causes me. In all art, in anything, there is nothing like the perfection of Mozart, nothing to compare with the range of feeling he explores, nothing to equal the contrast between the simplicity of the materials and the complexity and effect of his use of them. The piano concertos themselves exhibit these truths at their most intense; he was a greater master of this form than of the symphony itself, and to hear every one of them, in the astounding abundance of genius they provide, played as I have so recently heard them played, is to be brought face to face with a mystery which, if we could solve it, would solve the mystery of life itself.\n\nWe can see Mozart, from infant prodigy to unmarked grave. We know what he did, what he wrote, what he felt, whom he loved, where he went, what he died of. We pile up such knowledge as a child does bricks; and then we hear the little tripping rondo tune of the last concerto-and the bricks collapse; all our knowledge is useless to explain a single bar of it. It is almost enough to make me believe in-but I have run out of space, and don\u2019t have to say it. Put K. 595 on the gramophone and say it for me.",

        "At the public radio station KEXP in Seattle, there\u2019s a simple procedure for evaluating new technology. \u201cWe just go ahead and do stuff,\u201d says one of the station\u2019s morning disc jockeys. That\u2019s how the quirky station created one of the first music podcasts-without support from major record companies.\n\nA podcast is a digital recording of a radio-style audio program that can be downloaded from the Internet and played on a digital music player. Many podcasters think the technology could revolutionize radio as TiVo did television.\n\nPodcasting is a great way for KEXP to reach thousands of new listeners, especially those outside of Seattle. But the station can\u2019t podcast programs such as John in the morning-a variety of independent and mainstream music-because record companies haven\u2019t provided an easy, affordable way for podcasters to license songs. That\u2019s why most podcasts today are talk radio.\n\nKEXP decided that it couldn\u2019t sit around and wait and wait for a major label to sign off on this. So it invited 14 unsigned or small bands from the Seattle area to contribute songs to a podcast. The station asked a lawyer-a listener who volunteers at the station-to draw up a simple contract for the bands. KEXP did not release numbers but said the podcast was a hit. KEXP is now podcasting some live performances to which it owns the rights.\n\nSince podcasts are recordings, they can be played at any time. Listeners can pause, fast-forward or rewind them. And since podcasts are posted online, listeners can download programs from radio stations and independent broadcasters from all over the world. The podcasts can also be hacked and pirated. An enterprising listener could pull songs out of a podcast and turn them into music files or CDs.\n\nThat\u2019s why many record companies say the technology is promising but problematic. But record labels worry that listeners will pirate the songs contained in the downloaded radio shows. For example, OK Go and several other emerging bands with EMI have their own podcasts.

        "It was on the 28th of July, which I believe was a Wednesday, that I visited my father for the first time during his illness and for the last time in his life. The moment that I saw him I knew why I had put off this visit so long. I had told my mother that I did not want to see him because I hated him. But this was not true. It was only that I had hated him and I wanted to hold on to this hatred. I did not want to look on him as a ruin: it was not a ruin I had hated. I imagine that one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once hate is gone, that they will be forced to deal with pain.\nWe traveled out to him, his older sister and myself, to what seemed to be the very end of a very Long Island. It was hot and dusty and we wrangled, my aunt and I, all the way out, over the fact that I had recently begun to smoke and, as she said, to give myself airs. But I knew that she wrangled with me because she could not bear to face the fact of her brother\u2019s dying. Neither could I endure the reality of her despair, her unstated bafflement as to what had happened to her brother\u2019s life, and her own. So we wrangled and I smoked and from time to time she fell into a heavy reverie. Covertly, I watched her face, which was the face of an old woman; it had fallen in. the eyes were sunken and lightless: soon she would be dying, too.\nIn my childhood-it had not been so long ago-I had thought her beautiful. She had been quick-witted and quick-moving and very generous with all the children and each of her visits had been an event. At one time one of my brothers and myself had thought of running away to live with her. Now she could no longer produce out of her handbag some unexpected and yet familiar delight. She made me feel pity and revulsion and fear. It was awful to realize that she no longer caused me to feel affection. The closer we came to the hospital the more querulous she became and at the same time, naturally, grew more dependent on me. Between pity and guilt and fear I began to feel that there was another me trapped in my skull like a jack-in-the-box who might escape my control at any moment and fill the air with screaming.\nShe began to cry the moment we entered the room and she saw him lying there, all shriveled and still, like a little black monkey. The great, gleaming apparatus which fed him and would have compelled him to be still even if he had been able to move brought to mind, not beneficence, but torture; the tubes entering his arm made me think of pictures I had seen when a child, of Gulliver, tied down by the pygmies on that island. My aunt wept and, wept, there was a whistling sound in my father\u2019s throat; nothing was said: he could not speak. I wanted to take his hand, to say something. But I do not know what I could have said, even if he could have heard me. He was not really in that room with us, he bad at last really embarked on his journey; and though my aunt told me that he said he was going to meet Jesus. I did not hear anything except that whistling in his throat. The doctor came back and we left into that unbearable train again, and home. In the morning came the telegram saving that he was dead. Then the house was suddenly full of relatives, friends, hysteria, and confusion and I quickly left my mother and the children to the care of those impressive women, who, in Negro communities at least, automatically appear at times of bereavement armed with lotions proverbs and patience and an ability to cook. I went downtown. By the time I returned later the same day, my mother had been carried to the hospital and the baby had been born.",

        "It was on the 28th of July, which I believe was a Wednesday, that I visited my father for the first time during his illness and for the last time in his life. The moment that I saw him I knew why I had put off this visit so long. I had told my mother that I did not want to see him because I hated him. But this was not true. It was only that I had hated him and I wanted to hold on to this hatred. I did not want to look on him as a ruin: it was not a ruin I had hated. I imagine that one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once hate is gone, that they will be forced to deal with pain.\nWe traveled out to him, his older sister and myself, to what seemed to be the very end of a very Long Island. It was hot and dusty and we wrangled, my aunt and I, all the way out, over the fact that I had recently begun to smoke and, as she said, to give myself airs. But I knew that she wrangled with me because she could not bear to face the fact of her brother\u2019s dying. Neither could I endure the reality of her despair, her unstated bafflement as to what had happened to her brother\u2019s life, and her own. So we wrangled and I smoked and from time to time she fell into a heavy reverie. Covertly, I watched her face, which was the face of an old woman; it had fallen in. the eyes were sunken and lightless: soon she would be dying, too.\nIn my childhood-it had not been so long ago-I had thought her beautiful. She had been quick-witted and quick-moving and very generous with all the children and each of her visits had been an event. At one time one of my brothers and myself had thought of running away to live with her. Now she could no longer produce out of her handbag some unexpected and yet familiar delight. She made me feel pity and revulsion and fear. It was awful to realize that she no longer caused me to feel affection. The closer we came to the hospital the more querulous she became and at the same time, naturally, grew more dependent on me. Between pity and guilt and fear I began to feel that there was another me trapped in my skull like a jack-in-the-box who might escape my control at any moment and fill the air with screaming.\nShe began to cry the moment we entered the room and she saw him lying there, all shriveled and still, like a little black monkey. The great, gleaming apparatus which fed him and would have compelled him to be still even if he had been able to move brought to mind, not beneficence, but torture; the tubes entering his arm made me think of pictures I had seen when a child, of Gulliver, tied down by the pygmies on that island. My aunt wept and, wept, there was a whistling sound in my father\u2019s throat; nothing was said: he could not speak. I wanted to take his hand, to say something. But I do not know what I could have said, even if he could have heard me. He was not really in that room with us, he bad at last really embarked on his journey; and though my aunt told me that he said he was going to meet Jesus. I did not hear anything except that whistling in his throat. The doctor came back and we left into that unbearable train again, and home. In the morning came the telegram saving that he was dead. Then the house was suddenly full of relatives, friends, hysteria, and confusion and I quickly left my mother and the children to the care of those impressive women, who, in Negro communities at least, automatically appear at times of bereavement armed with lotions proverbs and patience and an ability to cook. I went downtown. By the time I returned later the same day, my mother had been carried to the hospital and the baby had been born.",

        "It was on the 28th of July, which I believe was a Wednesday, that I visited my father for the first time during his illness and for the last time in his life. The moment that I saw him I knew why I had put off this visit so long. I had told my mother that I did not want to see him because I hated him. But this was not true. It was only that I had hated him and I wanted to hold on to this hatred. I did not want to look on him as a ruin: it was not a ruin I had hated. I imagine that one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once hate is gone, that they will be forced to deal with pain.\nWe traveled out to him, his older sister and myself, to what seemed to be the very end of a very Long Island. It was hot and dusty and we wrangled, my aunt and I, all the way out, over the fact that I had recently begun to smoke and, as she said, to give myself airs. But I knew that she wrangled with me because she could not bear to face the fact of her brother\u2019s dying. Neither could I endure the reality of her despair, her unstated bafflement as to what had happened to her brother\u2019s life, and her own. So we wrangled and I smoked and from time to time she fell into a heavy reverie. Covertly, I watched her face, which was the face of an old woman; it had fallen in. the eyes were sunken and lightless: soon she would be dying, too.\nIn my childhood-it had not been so long ago-I had thought her beautiful. She had been quick-witted and quick-moving and very generous with all the children and each of her visits had been an event. At one time one of my brothers and myself had thought of running away to live with her. Now she could no longer produce out of her handbag some unexpected and yet familiar delight. She made me feel pity and revulsion and fear. It was awful to realize that she no longer caused me to feel affection. The closer we came to the hospital the more querulous she became and at the same time, naturally, grew more dependent on me. Between pity and guilt and fear I began to feel that there was another me trapped in my skull like a jack-in-the-box who might escape my control at any moment and fill the air with screaming.\nShe began to cry the moment we entered the room and she saw him lying there, all shriveled and still, like a little black monkey. The great, gleaming apparatus which fed him and would have compelled him to be still even if he had been able to move brought to mind, not beneficence, but torture; the tubes entering his arm made me think of pictures I had seen when a child, of Gulliver, tied down by the pygmies on that island. My aunt wept and, wept, there was a whistling sound in my father\u2019s throat; nothing was said: he could not speak. I wanted to take his hand, to say something. But I do not know what I could have said, even if he could have heard me. He was not really in that room with us, he bad at last really embarked on his journey; and though my aunt told me that he said he was going to meet Jesus. I did not hear anything except that whistling in his throat. The doctor came back and we left into that unbearable train again, and home. In the morning came the telegram saving that he was dead. Then the house was suddenly full of relatives, friends, hysteria, and confusion and I quickly left my mother and the children to the care of those impressive women, who, in Negro communities at least, automatically appear at times of bereavement armed with lotions proverbs and patience and an ability to cook. I went downtown. By the time I returned later the same day, my mother had been carried to the hospital and the baby had been born.",

        "With the understanding of phobias has come a magic bag of treatments: exposure therapy that can stomp out a lifetime phobia in a single six-hour session; virtual-reality programs that can safely simulate the thing the phobia most fears, slowly stripping it of its power to terrorize; new medications that can snuff the brain\u2019s phobic spark before it can catch.\n\nIn the past year, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first drug \u2013 an existing antidepressant.\n\nMost psychologists now assign phobias to one of the three broad categories: social phobias, in which the sufferer feels paralyzing fear at the prospect of social or professional encounters; panic disorders, in which the person is periodically blindsided by overwhelming fear for no apparent reason; and specific phobias-fear of snakes and enclosed spaces and heights and the like.\n\nIf you are living with a generalized sense of danger, it can be profoundly therapeutic to find a single object on which to deposit all that unformed fear-a snake, a spider and a rat. A specific phobia becomes a sort of backfire for fear, a controlled blaze that prevents other blazes from catching.\n\nBut a condition that is so easy to pick up is becoming almost as easy to shake, usually without resort to drugs. What turns up the wattage of a phobia the most is the strategy the phobias rely on to ease their discomfort: avoidance. The harder phobics work to avoid the things they fear, the more the brain grows convinced that the threat is real.\n\nProgress in treating social-anxiety disorder is also providing hope for the last-and most disabling-of the family of phobias: panic disorder. Panic disorder is to anxiety conditions what a tornado is to weather conditions: a devastating sneaks havoc and then simply vanishes. Unlike the specific phobic and the social phobic who know what will trigger their fear, the victim of panic attacks never know where or when one will hit. Someone who experiences an attack in, say, a supermarket will often not return there, associating the once neutral place with the traumatic event. But the perceived circle of safety can quickly shrink, until sufferers may be confined entirely to their homes. When this begins to happen, panic disorder mutates into full-blown agoraphobia. The treatment for agoraphobia is much the same as it is for social phobia: cognitive-behavioral therapy and drugs.",

        "It was on the 28th of July, which I believe was a Wednesday, that I visited my father for the first time during his illness and for the last time in his life. The moment that I saw him I knew why I had put off this visit so long. I had told my mother that I did not want to see him because I hated him. But this was not true. It was only that I had hated him and I wanted to hold on to this hatred. I did not want to look on him as a ruin: it was not a ruin I had hated. I imagine that one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once hate is gone, that they will be forced to deal with pain.\nWe traveled out to him, his older sister and myself, to what seemed to be the very end of a very Long Island. It was hot and dusty and we wrangled, my aunt and I, all the way out, over the fact that I had recently begun to smoke and, as she said, to give myself airs. But I knew that she wrangled with me because she could not bear to face the fact of her brother\u2019s dying. Neither could I endure the reality of her despair, her unstated bafflement as to what had happened to her brother\u2019s life, and her own. So we wrangled and I smoked and from time to time she fell into a heavy reverie. Covertly, I watched her face, which was the face of an old woman; it had fallen in. the eyes were sunken and lightless: soon she would be dying, too.\nIn my childhood-it had not been so long ago-I had thought her beautiful. She had been quick-witted and quick-moving and very generous with all the children and each of her visits had been an event. At one time one of my brothers and myself had thought of running away to live with her. Now she could no longer produce out of her handbag some unexpected and yet familiar delight. She made me feel pity and revulsion and fear. It was awful to realize that she no longer caused me to feel affection. The closer we came to the hospital the more querulous she became and at the same time, naturally, grew more dependent on me. Between pity and guilt and fear I began to feel that there was another me trapped in my skull like a jack-in-the-box who might escape my control at any moment and fill the air with screaming.\nShe began to cry the moment we entered the room and she saw him lying there, all shriveled and still, like a little black monkey. The great, gleaming apparatus which fed him and would have compelled him to be still even if he had been able to move brought to mind, not beneficence, but torture; the tubes entering his arm made me think of pictures I had seen when a child, of Gulliver, tied down by the pygmies on that island. My aunt wept and, wept, there was a whistling sound in my father\u2019s throat; nothing was said: he could not speak. I wanted to take his hand, to say something. But I do not know what I could have said, even if he could have heard me. He was not really in that room with us, he bad at last really embarked on his journey; and though my aunt told me that he said he was going to meet Jesus. I did not hear anything except that whistling in his throat. The doctor came back and we left into that unbearable train again, and home. In the morning came the telegram saving that he was dead. Then the house was suddenly full of relatives, friends, hysteria, and confusion and I quickly left my mother and the children to the care of those impressive women, who, in Negro communities at least, automatically appear at times of bereavement armed with lotions proverbs and patience and an ability to cook. I went downtown. By the time I returned later the same day, my mother had been carried to the hospital and the baby had been born.",

A study done by the University of Michigan School of Public Health revealed particulars that seem to hold true for the general population.

After the age of three, girls are more susceptible than boys, and teenage girls average three colds a year to boys\u2019 two.\n\nThe general incidence of colds continues to decline into maturity. Elderly people who are in good health have as few as one or two colds annually. One exception is found among people in their twenties, especially women, who show a rise in cold infections, because people in this age group are most likely to have young children. Adults who delay having children until their thirties and forties experience the same sudden increase in cold infections. The study also found that economics plays an important role. As income increases, the frequency at which colds are reported in the family decreases. Families with the lowest income suffer about a third more colds than families at the upper end. Lower income generally forces people to live in more cramped quarters than those typically occupied by wealthier people, and crowding increases the opportunities for the cold virus to travel from person to person. Low income may also adversely influence diet.

        "It was on the 28th of July, which I believe was a Wednesday, that I visited my father for the first time during his illness and for the last time in his life. The moment that I saw him I knew why I had put off this visit so long. I had told my mother that I did not want to see him because I hated him. But this was not true. It was only that I had hated him and I wanted to hold on to this hatred. I did not want to look on him as a ruin: it was not a ruin I had hated. I imagine that one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once hate is gone, that they will be forced to deal with pain.\nWe traveled out to him, his older sister and myself, to what seemed to be the very end of a very Long Island. It was hot and dusty and we wrangled, my aunt and I, all the way out, over the fact that I had recently begun to smoke and, as she said, to give myself airs. But I knew that she wrangled with me because she could not bear to face the fact of her brother\u2019s dying. Neither could I endure the reality of her despair, her unstated bafflement as to what had happened to her brother\u2019s life, and her own. So we wrangled and I smoked and from time to time she fell into a heavy reverie. Covertly, I watched her face, which was the face of an old woman; it had fallen in. the eyes were sunken and lightless: soon she would be dying, too.\nIn my childhood-it had not been so long ago-I had thought her beautiful. She had been quick-witted and quick-moving and very generous with all the children and each of her visits had been an event. At one time one of my brothers and myself had thought of running away to live with her. Now she could no longer produce out of her handbag some unexpected and yet familiar delight. She made me feel pity and revulsion and fear. It was awful to realize that she no longer caused me to feel affection. The closer we came to the hospital the more querulous she became and at the same time, naturally, grew more dependent on me. Between pity and guilt and fear I began to feel that there was another me trapped in my skull like a jack-in-the-box who might escape my control at any moment and fill the air with screaming.\nShe began to cry the moment we entered the room and she saw him lying there, all shriveled and still, like a little black monkey. The great, gleaming apparatus which fed him and would have compelled him to be still even if he had been able to move brought to mind, not beneficence, but torture; the tubes entering his arm made me think of pictures I had seen when a child, of Gulliver, tied down by the pygmies on that island. My aunt wept and, wept, there was a whistling sound in my father\u2019s throat; nothing was said: he could not speak. I wanted to take his hand, to say something. But I do not know what I could have said, even if he could have heard me. He was not really in that room with us, he bad at last really embarked on his journey; and though my aunt told me that he said he was going to meet Jesus. I did not hear anything except that whistling in his throat. The doctor came back and we left into that unbearable train again, and home. In the morning came the telegram saving that he was dead. Then the house was suddenly full of relatives, friends, hysteria, and confusion and I quickly left my mother and the children to the care of those impressive women, who, in Negro communities at least, automatically appear at times of bereavement armed with lotions proverbs and patience and an ability to cook. I went downtown. By the time I returned later the same day, my mother had been carried to the hospital and the baby had been born.",

        "Smallpox was the first widespread disease to be eliminated by human intervention. A highly contagious viral disease, it was endemic in Europe, causing the death of millions of people until the development of vaccination by Edward Jenner around 1800. In many non- European nations, it remained a dreaded, often fatal illness until very recently.\n\nIn May 1966, the World Health Organization \uff08WHO\uff09, an agency of the United Nations, was authorized to initiate a global campaign to eradicate smallpox. The goal was to eliminate the disease in one decade. At the time, the disease posed a serious threat to people in thirty nations. More than 700 physicians, nurses, scientists, and other personnel from WHO joined about 200,000 health workers in the infected nations to battle the disease. Because similar projects for malaria and yellow fever had failed, few believed that smallpox could actually be eradicated, but eleven years after the initial organization of the campaign, no cases were reported in the field.\n\nThe strategy was not only to provide mass vaccinations but also to isolate patients with active smallpox in order to contain the spread of the disease and to break the chain of human transmission. Rewards for reporting smallpox assisted in motivating the public to aid health workers. One by one, each smallpox victim was sought out, removed from contact with others and treated.

        "It was on the 28th of July, which I believe was a Wednesday, that I visited my father for the first time during his illness and for the last time in his life. The moment that I saw him I knew why I had put off this visit so long. I had told my mother that I did not want to see him because I hated him. But this was not true. It was only that I had hated him and I wanted to hold on to this hatred. I did not want to look on him as a ruin: it was not a ruin I had hated. I imagine that one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once hate is gone, that they will be forced to deal with pain.\nWe traveled out to him, his older sister and myself, to what seemed to be the very end of a very Long Island. It was hot and dusty and we wrangled, my aunt and I, all the way out, over the fact that I had recently begun to smoke and, as she said, to give myself airs. But I knew that she wrangled with me because she could not bear to face the fact of her brother\u2019s dying. Neither could I endure the reality of her despair, her unstated bafflement as to what had happened to her brother\u2019s life, and her own. So we wrangled and I smoked and from time to time she fell into a heavy reverie. Covertly, I watched her face, which was the face of an old woman; it had fallen in. the eyes were sunken and lightless: soon she would be dying, too.\nIn my childhood-it had not been so long ago-I had thought her beautiful. She had been quick-witted and quick-moving and very generous with all the children and each of her visits had been an event. At one time one of my brothers and myself had thought of running away to live with her. Now she could no longer produce out of her handbag some unexpected and yet familiar delight. She made me feel pity and revulsion and fear. It was awful to realize that she no longer caused me to feel affection. The closer we came to the hospital the more querulous she became and at the same time, naturally, grew more dependent on me. Between pity and guilt and fear I began to feel that there was another me trapped in my skull like a jack-in-the-box who might escape my control at any moment and fill the air with screaming.\nShe began to cry the moment we entered the room and she saw him lying there, all shriveled and still, like a little black monkey. The great, gleaming apparatus which fed him and would have compelled him to be still even if he had been able to move brought to mind, not beneficence, but torture; the tubes entering his arm made me think of pictures I had seen when a child, of Gulliver, tied down by the pygmies on that island. My aunt wept and, wept, there was a whistling sound in my father\u2019s throat; nothing was said: he could not speak. I wanted to take his hand, to say something. But I do not know what I could have said, even if he could have heard me. He was not really in that room with us, he bad at last really embarked on his journey; and though my aunt told me that he said he was going to meet Jesus. I did not hear anything except that whistling in his throat. The doctor came back and we left into that unbearable train again, and home. In the morning came the telegram saving that he was dead. Then the house was suddenly full of relatives, friends, hysteria, and confusion and I quickly left my mother and the children to the care of those impressive women, who, in Negro communities at least, automatically appear at times of bereavement armed with lotions proverbs and patience and an ability to cook. I went downtown. By the time I returned later the same day, my mother had been carried to the hospital and the baby had been born.",

The moment that I saw him I knew why I had put off this visit so long. I had told my mother that I did not want to see him because I hated him. But this was not true. It was only that I had hated him and I wanted to hold on to this hatred. I did not want to look on him as a ruin: it was not a ruin I had hated. I imagine that one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once hate is gone, that they will be forced to deal with pain.\nWe traveled out to him, his older sister and myself, to what seemed to be the very end of a very Long Island. It was hot and dusty and we wrangled, my aunt and I, all the way out, over the fact that I had recently begun to smoke and, as she said, to give myself airs. But I knew that she wrangled with me because she could not bear to face the fact of her brother\u2019s dying. Neither could I endure the reality of her despair, her unstated bafflement as to what had happened to her brother\u2019s life, and her own. So we wrangled and I smoked and from time to time she fell into a heavy reverie. Covertly, I watched her face, which was the face of an old woman; it had fallen in. the eyes were sunken and lightless: soon she would be dying, too.\nIn my childhood-it had not been so long ago-I had thought her beautiful. She had been quick-witted and quick-moving and very generous with all the children and each of her visits had been an event. At one time one of my brothers and myself had thought of running away to live with her. Now she could no longer produce out of her handbag some unexpected and yet familiar delight. She made me feel pity and revulsion and fear. It was awful to realize that she no longer caused me to feel affection. The closer we came to the hospital the more querulous she became and at the same time, naturally, grew more dependent on me. Between pity and guilt and fear I began to feel that there was another me trapped in my skull like a jack-in-the-box who might escape my control at any moment and fill the air with screaming.\nShe began to cry the moment we entered the room and she saw him lying there, all shriveled and still, like a little black monkey. The great, gleaming apparatus which fed him and would have compelled him to be still even if he had been able to move brought to mind, not beneficence, but torture; the tubes entering his arm made me think of pictures I had seen when a child, of Gulliver, tied down by the pygmies on that island. My aunt wept and, wept, there was a whistling sound in my father\u2019s throat; nothing was said: he could not speak. I wanted to take his hand, to say something. But I do not know what I could have said, even if he could have heard me. He was not really in that room with us, he bad at last really embarked on his journey; and though my aunt told me that he said he was going to meet Jesus. I did not hear anything except that whistling in his throat. The doctor came back and we left into that unbearable train again, and home. In the morning came the telegram saving that he was dead. Then the house was suddenly full of relatives, friends, hysteria, and confusion and I quickly left my mother and the children to the care of those impressive women, who, in Negro communities at least, automatically appear at times of bereavement armed with lotions proverbs and patience and an ability to cook.

They might be making people sick, too.\n\nThe name given to this single-cell organism, or dinofiagellate, is Pfiesteria piscimorte -literally, \u201cfish killer. \u201d It was discovered at North Carolina State University in 1988, but at the same time, few scientists believed in its existence, much less in its highly unusual predatory nature. But ongoing research has led to international acknowledgment of the phenomenon and, recently, research funding.\n\nSeemingly prompted by an unknown substance secreted by fish, the aggressive creature swims into action. It sends neurotoxins into the water and air, paralyzing a fish\u2019s nervous system, and causing it to gasp for air at the surface. Eventually the fish suffocates. The killer dinoflagellate then attaches itself to the fish and begins sucking away at its flesh.

        "\u201cThe language of a composer\u201d, Cardus wrote, \u201chis harmonies, rhythms, melodies, colors and texture, cannot be separated except bypedantic analysis from the mind and sensibility of the artist who happens to be expressing himself through them\u201d.\n\nBut that is precisely the trouble; for as far as I can see, Mozart\u2019s can. Mozart make me begin to see ghosts, or at the very least ouija-boards. If you read Beethoven\u2019s letters you feel that you are at the heart of a tempest, a whirlwind, a furnace; and so you should, because you are. If you read Wagner\u2019s, you feel that you have been run over by a tank, and that, too, is an appropriate response.\n\nBut if you read Mozart\u2019s -and he was a hugely prolific letter-writer-you have no clue at all to the power that drove him and the music it squeezed out of him in such profusion that death alone could stop it; they reveal nothing-nothing that explains it. Of course it is absurd \uff08though the mistake is frequently made\uff09 to seek external causes for particular works of music; but with Mozart it is also absurd, or at any rate useless, to seek for internal ones either. Mozart was an instrument. But who was playing it?\n\nThat is what I mean by the Mozart Problem and the anxiety it causes me. In all art, in anything, there is nothing like the perfection of Mozart, nothing to compare with the range of feeling he explores, nothing to equal the contrast between the simplicity of the materials and the complexity and effect of his use of them. The piano concertos themselves exhibit these truths at their most intense; he was a greater master of this form than of the symphony itself, and to hear every one of them, in the astounding abundance of genius they provide, played as I have so recently heard them played, is to be brought face to face with a mystery which, if we could solve it, would solve the mystery of life itself.\n\nWe can see Mozart, from infant prodigy to unmarked grave. We know what he did, what he wrote, what he felt, whom he loved, where he went, what he died of. We pile up such knowledge as a child does bricks; and then we hear the little tripping rondo tune of the last concerto-and the bricks collapse; all our knowledge is useless to explain a single bar of it. It is almost enough to make me believe in-but I have run out of space, and don\u2019t have to say it. Put K. 595 on the gramophone and say it for me.",

        "Lichens may grow on the bark of a tree in a steaming tropical rain forest, on the bricks of big city buildings, on rocks in hot springs, on wind-swept mountaintops, and in the driest desserts. In the arctic, they provide the principal food for caribou, and they are one of the few plants that grow in Antarctica. They are pioneers, appearing in barren rocky areas and starting the formation of soil in which mosses, then ferns, and then other plants can take root.\n\nLichens are a partnership of two plants-fungi and algae. The lichen body is made up of a network of fungal strands. In the upper layers of these grow groups of algae. The two organisms live together to the benefit of both, a relationship known as symbiosis. The fungi provide support, absorb water, and shelter the tender algae from direct sunlight. The algae carry on photosynthesis and provide the fungi with food. The algae can live independently and are recognizable as a species that grows alone. The fungi, on the other hand, cannot live apart from their partners. They can be placed in known classes of fungi but are unlike any species that lives independently.\n\nSo definite are the form, color, and characteristics of these double organisms that for hundreds of years, they were classified as one. More than 15,000 \u201cspecies\u201d were named. If these organisms are classified as separate species, it is difficult to fit them into the existing system of classification. But if they are classified separately, these species of fungi seem rather strange. Lichens are a splendid example of the difficulties faced by taxonomists in classifying species.",

Time and maturity should have diminished the pain, because the incident happened more than 20 years ago. Occasionally, however, a smug smile triggers the memory, and I think, \u201cI should have done something. \u201d Some act of defiance could have killed and buried the memory of the incident. Now it\u2019s too late.\n\nIn 1969, I was a senior on the Luther Burbank High School basketball team. The school is on the south side of San Antonio, in one of the city\u2019s many barrios. After practice one day our coach announced that we were going to spend the following Saturday scrimmaging with the ball club from Winston Churchill High, located in the city\u2019s rich, white north side. After the basketball game, we were to select someone from the opposing team and \u201cbuddy up\u201d-talk with him, have lunch with him and generally spend the day attempting friendship. By telling us that this experience would go both teams some good, I suspect our well-intentioned coach was thinking about the possible benefits of integration and of learning to appreciate the differences of other people. By integrating us with this more prosperous group, I think he was also trying to inspire us.\n\nBut my teammates and I smiled sardonically at one another, and our sneakers squeaked as we nervously rubbed them against the waxed hardwood floor of our gym. The prospect of a full day of unfavorable comparisons drew from us a collective groan. As \u201cbarrio boys\u201d, we were already acutely aware of the differences between us and them. Churchill meant \u201cwhite\u201d to us: It meant shiny new cars, two-story homes with fireplaces, pedigree dogs and manicured hedges. In other words, everything that we did not have. Worse, traveling north meant putting up a front, to ourselves as well as to the Churchill team. We felt we had to pretend that we were cavalier about it all, tough guys who didn\u2019t care about \u201cnothing\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s clear now that we entered the contest with negative images of ourselves. From childhood, we must have suspected something was inherently wrong with us. The evidence wrapped, itself around our collective psyche like a noose. In elementary school, we were not allowed to speak Spanish. The bladed edge of a wooden ruler once came crashing down on my knuckles for violating this dictum. By high school, however, policies had changed, and we could speak Spanish without fear of physical reprisal. Still, speaking our language before whites brought on spasms of shame-for the supposed inferiority of our language and culture-and guilt at feeling shame. That mixture of emotions fueled our burning sense of inferiority.\n\nAfter all, our mothers in no way resembled the glamorized models of American TV mothers-Donna Reed baking cookies in high heels. My mother\u2019s hands were rough and chafed, her wardrobe drab and worn. And my father was preoccupied with making ends meet. His silence starkly contrasted with the glib counsel Jim Anderson offered in \u201cFather Knows Best\u201d. And where the Beaver worried about trying to understand some difficult homework assignment, for me it was an altogether different horror, when I was told by my elementary school principal that I did not have the ability to learn.\n\nAfter I failed to pass the first grade, my report card read that I had a \u201clearning disability\u201d. What shame and disillusion it brought my parents! To have carried their dream of a better life from Mexico to America, only to have their hopes quashed by having their only son branded inadequate. And so somewhere during my schooling I assumed that saying I had a \u201cretarded\u201d. School administrators didn\u2019t care that I could not speak English.\n\nAs teenagers, of course, my Mexican-American friends and I did not consciously understand why we felt inferior. But we might have understood if we had fathomed our desperate need to trounce Churchill. We viewed the prospect of beating a white, north-side squad as a particularly fine coup. The match was clearly racial, our need to succeed born of a defiance against prejudice. I see now that we sued the basketball court to prove our \u201cblood\u201d. And who better to confirm us, if not those whom we considered better? In retrospect, I realize the only thing confirmed that day was that we saw ourselves as negatively as they did.\n\nAfter we won the morning scrimmage, both teams were led from the gym into an empty room where everyone sat on a shiny linoleum floor. We were supposed to mingle-rub the colors together. But the teams sat separately, our backs against concrete walls. We faced one another like enemies, the empty floor between us a no man\u2019s land. As the coaches walked away, one reminded us to share lunch. God! The mere thought of offering them a taco from our brown bags when they had refrigerated deli lunches horrified us.\n\nThen one of their players tossed a bag of Fritos at us. It slid across the slippery floor and stopped in the center of the room. With heart beating anxiously, we Chicanos stared at the bag as the boy said with a sneer, \u201cY\u2019all probably like \u2018era\u201d-the \u201cFrito Bandito\u201d commercial being popular then. And we could see them, smiling at each other, giggling, jabbing their elbows into one another\u2019s ribs at the joke.\n\nThe bag seemed to grow before our eyes like a monstrous symbol of inferiority.\n\nWe won the afternoon basketball game as well. But winning had accomplished nothing. Though we had wanted to, we couldn\u2019t change their perception of us. It seems, in fact, that defeating them made them meaner. Looking back, I feel these young men needed to put us \u201cin our place\u201d, to reaffirm the power they felt we had threatened. I think, moreover, that they felt justified, not only because of their inherent sense of superiority, but because our failure to respond to their insult underscored our worth-lessness in their eyes.\n\nTwo decades later, the memory of their gloating lives on in me. When a white person is discourteous, I find myself wondering what I should do, and afterward, if I\u2019ve done the right thing. Sometimes I argue when a daft comment would suffice.

        "Now and then I can still see their faces, snickering and laughing, their eyes mocking me. And it bothers me that I should remember. Time and maturity should have diminished the pain, because the incident happened more than 20 years ago. Occasionally, however, a smug smile triggers the memory, and I think, \u201cI should have done something. \u201d Some act of defiance could have killed and buried the memory of the incident. Now it\u2019s too late.\n\nIn 1969, I was a senior on the Luther Burbank High School basketball team. The school is on the south side of San Antonio, in one of the city\u2019s many barrios. After practice one day our coach announced that we were going to spend the following Saturday scrimmaging with the ball club from Winston Churchill High, located in the city\u2019s rich, white north side. After the basketball game, we were to select someone from the opposing team and \u201cbuddy up\u201d-talk with him, have lunch with him and generally spend the day attempting friendship. By telling us that this experience would go both teams some good, I suspect our well-intentioned coach was thinking about the possible benefits of integration and of learning to appreciate the differences of other people. By integrating us with this more prosperous group, I think he was also trying to inspire us.\n\nBut my teammates and I smiled sardonically at one another, and our sneakers squeaked as we nervously rubbed them against the waxed hardwood floor of our gym. The prospect of a full day of unfavorable comparisons drew from us a collective groan. As \u201cbarrio boys\u201d, we were already acutely aware of the differences between us and them. Churchill meant \u201cwhite\u201d to us: It meant shiny new cars, two-story homes with fireplaces, pedigree dogs and manicured hedges. In other words, everything that we did not have. Worse, traveling north meant putting up a front, to ourselves as well as to the Churchill team. We felt we had to pretend that we were cavalier about it all, tough guys who didn\u2019t care about \u201cnothing\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s clear now that we entered the contest with negative images of ourselves. From childhood, we must have suspected something was inherently wrong with us. The evidence wrapped, itself around our collective psyche like a noose. In elementary school, we were not allowed to speak Spanish. The bladed edge of a wooden ruler once came crashing down on my knuckles for violating this dictum. By high school, however, policies had changed, and we could speak Spanish without fear of physical reprisal. Still, speaking our language before whites brought on spasms of shame-for the supposed inferiority of our language and culture-and guilt at feeling shame. That mixture of emotions fueled our burning sense of inferiority.\n\nAfter all, our mothers in no way resembled the glamorized models of American TV mothers-Donna Reed baking cookies in high heels. My mother\u2019s hands were rough and chafed, her wardrobe drab and worn. And my father was preoccupied with making ends meet. His silence starkly contrasted with the glib counsel Jim Anderson offered in \u201cFather Knows Best\u201d. And where the Beaver worried about trying to understand some difficult homework assignment, for me it was an altogether different horror, when I was told by my elementary school principal that I did not have the ability to learn.\n\nAfter I failed to pass the first grade, my report card read that I had a \u201clearning disability\u201d. What shame and disillusion it brought my parents! To have carried their dream of a better life from Mexico to America, only to have their hopes quashed by having their only son branded inadequate. And so somewhere during my schooling I assumed that saying I had a \u201cretarded\u201d. School administrators didn\u2019t care that I could not speak English.\n\nAs teenagers, of course, my Mexican-American friends and I did not consciously understand why we felt inferior. But we might have understood if we had fathomed our desperate need to trounce Churchill. We viewed the prospect of beating a white, north-side squad as a particularly fine coup. The match was clearly racial, our need to succeed born of a defiance against prejudice. I see now that we sued the basketball court to prove our \u201cblood\u201d. And who better to confirm us, if not those whom we considered better? In retrospect, I realize the only thing confirmed that day was that we saw ourselves as negatively as they did.\n\nAfter we won the morning scrimmage, both teams were led from the gym into an empty room where everyone sat on a shiny linoleum floor. We were supposed to mingle-rub the colors together. But the teams sat separately, our backs against concrete walls. We faced one another like enemies, the empty floor between us a no man\u2019s land. As the coaches walked away, one reminded us to share lunch. God! The mere thought of offering them a taco from our brown bags when they had refrigerated deli lunches horrified us.\n\nThen one of their players tossed a bag of Fritos at us. It slid across the slippery floor and stopped in the center of the room. With heart beating anxiously, we Chicanos stared at the bag as the boy said with a sneer, \u201cY\u2019all probably like \u2018era\u201d-the \u201cFrito Bandito\u201d commercial being popular then. And we could see them, smiling at each other, giggling, jabbing their elbows into one another\u2019s ribs at the joke.\n\nThe bag seemed to grow before our eyes like a monstrous symbol of inferiority.\n\nWe won the afternoon basketball game as well. But winning had accomplished nothing. Though we had wanted to, we couldn\u2019t change their perception of us. It seems, in fact, that defeating them made them meaner.

        "It was on the 28th of July, which I believe was a Wednesday, that I visited my father for the first time during his illness and for the last time in his life. The moment that I saw him I knew why I had put off this visit so long. I had told my mother that I did not want to see him because I hated him. But this was not true. It was only that I had hated him and I wanted to hold on to this hatred. I did not want to look on him as a ruin: it was not a ruin I had hated. I imagine that one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once hate is gone, that they will be forced to deal with pain.\nWe traveled out to him, his older sister and myself, to what seemed to be the very end of a very Long Island. It was hot and dusty and we wrangled, my aunt and I, all the way out, over the fact that I had recently begun to smoke and, as she said, to give myself airs. But I knew that she wrangled with me because she could not bear to face the fact of her brother\u2019s dying. Neither could I endure the reality of her despair, her unstated bafflement as to what had happened to her brother\u2019s life, and her own. So we wrangled and I smoked and from time to time she fell into a heavy reverie. Covertly, I watched her face, which was the face of an old woman; it had fallen in. the eyes were sunken and lightless: soon she would be dying, too.\nIn my childhood-it had not been so long ago-I had thought her beautiful. She had been quick-witted and quick-moving and very generous with all the children and each of her visits had been an event. At one time one of my brothers and myself had thought of running away to live with her. Now she could no longer produce out of her handbag some unexpected and yet familiar delight. She made me feel pity and revulsion and fear. It was awful to realize that she no longer caused me to feel affection. The closer we came to the hospital the more querulous she became and at the same time, naturally, grew more dependent on me. Between pity and guilt and fear I began to feel that there was another me trapped in my skull like a jack-in-the-box who might escape my control at any moment and fill the air with screaming.\nShe began to cry the moment we entered the room and she saw him lying there, all shriveled and still, like a little black monkey. The great, gleaming apparatus which fed him and would have compelled him to be still even if he had been able to move brought to mind, not beneficence, but torture; the tubes entering his arm made me think of pictures I had seen when a child, of Gulliver, tied down by the pygmies on that island. My aunt wept and, wept, there was a whistling sound in my father\u2019s throat; nothing was said: he could not speak. I wanted to take his hand, to say something. But I do not know what I could have said, even if he could have heard me. He was not really in that room with us, he bad at last really embarked on his journey; and though my aunt told me that he said he was going to meet Jesus. I did not hear anything except that whistling in his throat. The doctor came back and we left into that unbearable train again, and home. In the morning came the telegram saving that he was dead. Then the house was suddenly full of relatives, friends, hysteria, and confusion and I quickly left my mother and the children to the care of those impressive women, who, in Negro communities at least, automatically appear at times of bereavement armed with lotions proverbs and patience and an ability to cook. I went downtown. By the time I returned later the same day, my mother had been carried to the hospital and the baby had been born.",

        "Now and then I can still see their faces, snickering and laughing, their eyes mocking me. And it bothers me that I should remember. Time and maturity should have diminished the pain, because the incident happened more than 20 years ago. Occasionally, however, a smug smile triggers the memory, and I think, \u201cI should have done something. \u201d Some act of defiance could have killed and buried the memory of the incident. Now it\u2019s too late.\n\nIn 1969, I was a senior on the Luther Burbank High School basketball team. The school is on the south side of San Antonio, in one of the city\u2019s many barrios. After practice one day our coach announced that we were going to spend the following Saturday scrimmaging with the ball club from Winston Churchill High, located in the city\u2019s rich, white north side. After the basketball game, we were to select someone from the opposing team and \u201cbuddy up\u201d-talk with him, have lunch with him and generally spend the day attempting friendship. By telling us that this experience would go both teams some good, I suspect our well-intentioned coach was thinking about the possible benefits of integration and of learning to appreciate the differences of other people. By integrating us with this more prosperous group, I think he was also trying to inspire us.\n\nBut my teammates and I smiled sardonically at one another, and our sneakers squeaked as we nervously rubbed them against the waxed hardwood floor of our gym. The prospect of a full day of unfavorable comparisons drew from us a collective groan. As \u201cbarrio boys\u201d, we were already acutely aware of the differences between us and them. Churchill meant \u201cwhite\u201d to us: It meant shiny new cars, two-story homes with fireplaces, pedigree dogs and manicured hedges. In other words, everything that we did not have. Worse, traveling north meant putting up a front, to ourselves as well as to the Churchill team. We felt we had to pretend that we were cavalier about it all, tough guys who didn\u2019t care about \u201cnothing\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s clear now that we entered the contest with negative images of ourselves. From childhood, we must have suspected something was inherently wrong with us. The evidence wrapped, itself around our collective psyche like a noose. In elementary school, we were not allowed to speak Spanish. The bladed edge of a wooden ruler once came crashing down on my knuckles for violating this dictum. By high school, however, policies had changed, and we could speak Spanish without fear of physical reprisal. Still, speaking our language before whites brought on spasms of shame-for the supposed inferiority of our language and culture-and guilt at feeling shame. That mixture of emotions fueled our burning sense of inferiority.\n\nAfter all, our mothers in no way resembled the glamorized models of American TV mothers-Donna Reed baking cookies in high heels. My mother\u2019s hands were rough and chafed, her wardrobe drab and worn. And my father was preoccupied with making ends meet. His silence starkly contrasted with the glib counsel Jim Anderson offered in \u201cFather Knows Best\u201d.

        "No revolutions in technology have as visibly marked the human condition as those in transport. Moving goods and people, they have opened continents, transformed living standards, spread diseases, fashions and folk around the world. Yet technologies to transport ideas and information across long distances have arguably achieved even more: they have spread knowledge, the basis of economic growth.\n\nThe most basic of all these, the written word, was already ancient by 1000. By then China had, in basic form, the printing press, using carved woodblocks. But the key to its future, movable metal type was four centuries away. The Chinese were hampered by their thousands of ideograms. Even so, they quite soon invented the primitive movable type, made of clay, and by the 13th century they had the movable wooden type. But the real secret was the use of an easily cast metal.\n\nWhen it came, Europe-aided by simple Western alphabets-leapt forward with it. One reason why Asia\u2019s civilizations, in 1000 far ahead of Europe\u2019s, then fell behind was that they lacked the technology to reproduce and diffuse ideas. On Johannes Gutenberg\u2019s invention in the 1440s were built not just the Reformation and the Enlightenment, but Europe\u2019s agricultural and industrial revolutions too.\n\nYet information technology on its own would not have got far. Literally: better transport technology too was needed. That was not lacking, but here the big change came much later: \u00a0it was railways and steamships that first allowed the speedy, widespread dissemination of news and ideas over long distances. And both technologies in turn required people and organizations to develop their use. They got them: for individual communication, the postal service; for wider publics, the publishing industry.\n\nThroughout the 19th century, the postal-service formed the bedrock of national and international communications. Crucial to its growth had been the introduction of the stamp, combined with a low price, and payment by the sender. Britain put all three of these ideas into effect in 1840.\n\nBy then, the world\u2019s mail was taking off. It changed the world. Merchants in America\u2019s eastern cities used it to gather information, enraging far-off cotton growers and farmers, who found that New Yorkers knew more about crop prices than they did. In the American debate about slavery, it offered abolitionists a low-cost way to spread their views, just as later technologies have cut the cost and widened the scope of political lobbying. The post helped too to integrate the American nation, tying the newly opened west to the settled east.\n\nEverywhere, its development drove and was driven by those of transport. In Britain, travelers rode by mail coach to posting inns. In America, the post subsidized road-building. Indeed, argues Dan Schiller, a professor of communications at the University of California, it was the connection between the post, transport and national integration that ensured that the mail remained a public enterprise even in the United States, its first and only government-run communications medium, and until at least the1870s, the biggest organization in the land.\n\nThe change has not only been one of speed and distance, though, but of audience. About 200 years ago, a man\u2019s words could reach no further than his voice, not just in range but in whom they reached. But, for some purposes, efficient communication is mass communication, regular, cheap, quick and reliable. When it became possible, it transformed the world.",

Mozart make me begin to see ghosts, or at the very least ouija-boards. If you read Beethoven\u2019s letters you feel that you are at the heart of a tempest, a whirlwind, a furnace; and so you should, because you are. If you read Wagner\u2019s, you feel that you have been run over by a tank, and that, too, is an appropriate response.\n\nBut if you read Mozart\u2019s -and he was a hugely prolific letter-writer-you have no clue at all to the power that drove him and the music it squeezed out of him in such profusion that death alone could stop it; they reveal nothing-nothing that explains it. Of course it is absurd \uff08though the mistake is frequently made\uff09 to seek external causes for particular works of music; but with Mozart it is also absurd, or at any rate useless, to seek for internal ones either. Mozart was an instrument. But who was playing it?\n\nThat is what I mean by the Mozart Problem and the anxiety it causes me. In all art, in anything, there is nothing like the perfection of Mozart, nothing to compare with the range of feeling he explores, nothing to equal the contrast between the simplicity of the materials and the complexity and effect of his use of them. The piano concertos themselves exhibit these truths at their most intense; he was a greater master of this form than of the symphony itself, and to hear every one of them, in the astounding abundance of genius they provide, played as I have so recently heard them played, is to be brought face to face with a mystery which, if we could solve it, would solve the mystery of life itself.\n\nWe can see Mozart, from infant prodigy to unmarked grave. We know what he did, what he wrote, what he felt, whom he loved, where he went, what he died of. We pile up such knowledge as a child does bricks; and then we hear the little tripping rondo tune of the last concerto-and the bricks collapse; all our knowledge is useless to explain a single bar of it. It is almost enough to make me believe in-but I have run out of space, and don\u2019t have to say it. Put K. 595 on the gramophone and say it for me.",

Mozart make me begin to see ghosts, or at the very least ouija-boards. If you read Beethoven\u2019s letters you feel that you are at the heart of a tempest, a whirlwind, a furnace; and so you should, because you are. If you read Wagner\u2019s, you feel that you have been run over by a tank, and that, too, is an appropriate response.\n\nBut if you read Mozart\u2019s -and he was a hugely prolific letter-writer-you have no clue at all to the power that drove him and the music it squeezed out of him in such profusion that death alone could stop it; they reveal nothing-nothing that explains it. Of course it is absurd \uff08though the mistake is frequently made\uff09 to seek external causes for particular works of music; but with Mozart it is also absurd, or at any rate useless, to seek for internal ones either. Mozart was an instrument. But who was playing it?\n\nThat is what I mean by the Mozart Problem and the anxiety it causes me. In all art, in anything, there is nothing like the perfection of Mozart, nothing to compare with the range of feeling he explores, nothing to equal the contrast between the simplicity of the materials and the complexity and effect of his use of them. The piano concertos themselves exhibit these truths at their most intense; he was a greater master of this form than of the symphony itself, and to hear every one of them, in the astounding abundance of genius they provide, played as I have so recently heard them played, is to be brought face to face with a mystery which, if we could solve it, would solve the mystery of life itself.\n\nWe can see Mozart, from infant prodigy to unmarked grave. We know what he did, what he wrote, what he felt, whom he loved, where he went, what he died of. We pile up such knowledge as a child does bricks; and then we hear the little tripping rondo tune of the last concerto-and the bricks collapse; all our knowledge is useless to explain a single bar of it. It is almost enough to make me believe in-but I have run out of space, and don\u2019t have to say it. Put K. 595 on the gramophone and say it for me.",

Mozart make me begin to see ghosts, or at the very least ouija-boards. If you read Beethoven\u2019s letters you feel that you are at the heart of a tempest, a whirlwind, a furnace; and so you should, because you are. If you read Wagner\u2019s, you feel that you have been run over by a tank, and that, too, is an appropriate response.\n\nBut if you read Mozart\u2019s -and he was a hugely prolific letter-writer-you have no clue at all to the power that drove him and the music it squeezed out of him in such profusion that death alone could stop it; they reveal nothing-nothing that explains it. Of course it is absurd \uff08though the mistake is frequently made\uff09 to seek external causes for particular works of music; but with Mozart it is also absurd, or at any rate useless, to seek for internal ones either. Mozart was an instrument. But who was playing it?\n\nThat is what I mean by the Mozart Problem and the anxiety it causes me. In all art, in anything, there is nothing like the perfection of Mozart, nothing to compare with the range of feeling he explores, nothing to equal the contrast between the simplicity of the materials and the complexity and effect of his use of them. The piano concertos themselves exhibit these truths at their most intense; he was a greater master of this form than of the symphony itself, and to hear every one of them, in the astounding abundance of genius they provide, played as I have so recently heard them played, is to be brought face to face with a mystery which, if we could solve it, would solve the mystery of life itself.\n\nWe can see Mozart, from infant prodigy to unmarked grave. We know what he did, what he wrote, what he felt, whom he loved, where he went, what he died of. We pile up such knowledge as a child does bricks; and then we hear the little tripping rondo tune of the last concerto-and the bricks collapse; all our knowledge is useless to explain a single bar of it. It is almost enough to make me believe in-but I have run out of space, and don\u2019t have to say it. Put K. 595 on the gramophone and say it for me.",

Mozart make me begin to see ghosts, or at the very least ouija-boards. If you read Beethoven\u2019s letters you feel that you are at the heart of a tempest, a whirlwind, a furnace; and so you should, because you are. If you read Wagner\u2019s, you feel that you have been run over by a tank, and that, too, is an appropriate response.\n\nBut if you read Mozart\u2019s -and he was a hugely prolific letter-writer-you have no clue at all to the power that drove him and the music it squeezed out of him in such profusion that death alone could stop it; they reveal nothing-nothing that explains it. Of course it is absurd \uff08though the mistake is frequently made\uff09 to seek external causes for particular works of music; but with Mozart it is also absurd, or at any rate useless, to seek for internal ones either. Mozart was an instrument. But who was playing it?\n\nThat is what I mean by the Mozart Problem and the anxiety it causes me. In all art, in anything, there is nothing like the perfection of Mozart, nothing to compare with the range of feeling he explores, nothing to equal the contrast between the simplicity of the materials and the complexity and effect of his use of them. The piano concertos themselves exhibit these truths at their most intense; he was a greater master of this form than of the symphony itself, and to hear every one of them, in the astounding abundance of genius they provide, played as I have so recently heard them played, is to be brought face to face with a mystery which, if we could solve it, would solve the mystery of life itself.\n\nWe can see Mozart, from infant prodigy to unmarked grave. We know what he did, what he wrote, what he felt, whom he loved, where he went, what he died of. We pile up such knowledge as a child does bricks; and then we hear the little tripping rondo tune of the last concerto-and the bricks collapse; all our knowledge is useless to explain a single bar of it. It is almost enough to make me believe in-but I have run out of space, and don\u2019t have to say it. Put K. 595 on the gramophone and say it for me.",

It is a culture bombarded by English, in advertising, pop music, the Intemet, and despite all the English that Danish absorbs-there is no Danish Academy to defend against it.

However, Danes don\u2019t think of themselves as a waiting-at-2-a, m. -for-the-green-light people. Danes see themselves as jazzy people, improvisers, more free spirited than Swedes, but the truth is that Danes are very much like Germans and Swedes. Orderliness is a main selling point. Denmark has few natural resources and limited manufacturing capability; its future in Europe will be as a broker, banker, and distributor of goods. You send your goods by container ship to Copenhagen, and these bright, young, English-speaking, utterly honest, highly disciplined people will get your goods around to Scandinavia, the Baltic States and Russia. Airports, seaports, highways and rail lines are ultramodern and well-maintained.\n\nThe orderliness of the society doesn\u2019t mean that Danish lives are less messy or lonely than yours or mine, and no Dane would tell you so.

Mozart make me begin to see ghosts, or at the very least ouija-boards. If you read Beethoven\u2019s letters you feel that you are at the heart of a tempest, a whirlwind, a furnace; and so you should, because you are. If you read Wagner\u2019s, you feel that you have been run over by a tank, and that, too, is an appropriate response.\n\nBut if you read Mozart\u2019s -and he was a hugely prolific letter-writer-you have no clue at all to the power that drove him and the music it squeezed out of him in such profusion that death alone could stop it; they reveal nothing-nothing that explains it. Of course it is absurd \uff08though the mistake is frequently made\uff09 to seek external causes for particular works of music; but with Mozart it is also absurd, or at any rate useless, to seek for internal ones either. Mozart was an instrument. But who was playing it?\n\nThat is what I mean by the Mozart Problem and the anxiety it causes me. In all art, in anything, there is nothing like the perfection of Mozart, nothing to compare with the range of feeling he explores, nothing to equal the contrast between the simplicity of the materials and the complexity and effect of his use of them. The piano concertos themselves exhibit these truths at their most intense; he was a greater master of this form than of the symphony itself, and to hear every one of them, in the astounding abundance of genius they provide, played as I have so recently heard them played, is to be brought face to face with a mystery which, if we could solve it, would solve the mystery of life itself.\n\nWe can see Mozart, from infant prodigy to unmarked grave. We know what he did, what he wrote, what he felt, whom he loved, where he went, what he died of. We pile up such knowledge as a child does bricks; and then we hear the little tripping rondo tune of the last concerto-and the bricks collapse; all our knowledge is useless to explain a single bar of it. It is almost enough to make me believe in-but I have run out of space, and don\u2019t have to say it. Put K. 595 on the gramophone and say it for me.",

Mozart make me begin to see ghosts, or at the very least ouija-boards. If you read Beethoven\u2019s letters you feel that you are at the heart of a tempest, a whirlwind, a furnace; and so you should, because you are. If you read Wagner\u2019s, you feel that you have been run over by a tank, and that, too, is an appropriate response.\n\nBut if you read Mozart\u2019s -and he was a hugely prolific letter-writer-you have no clue at all to the power that drove him and the music it squeezed out of him in such profusion that death alone could stop it; they reveal nothing-nothing that explains it. Of course it is absurd \uff08though the mistake is frequently made\uff09 to seek external causes for particular works of music; but with Mozart it is also absurd, or at any rate useless, to seek for internal ones either. Mozart was an instrument. But who was playing it?\n\nThat is what I mean by the Mozart Problem and the anxiety it causes me. In all art, in anything, there is nothing like the perfection of Mozart, nothing to compare with the range of feeling he explores, nothing to equal the contrast between the simplicity of the materials and the complexity and effect of his use of them. The piano concertos themselves exhibit these truths at their most intense; he was a greater master of this form than of the symphony itself, and to hear every one of them, in the astounding abundance of genius they provide, played as I have so recently heard them played, is to be brought face to face with a mystery which, if we could solve it, would solve the mystery of life itself.\n\nWe can see Mozart, from infant prodigy to unmarked grave. We know what he did, what he wrote, what he felt, whom he loved, where he went, what he died of. We pile up such knowledge as a child does bricks; and then we hear the little tripping rondo tune of the last concerto-and the bricks collapse; all our knowledge is useless to explain a single bar of it. It is almost enough to make me believe in-but I have run out of space, and don\u2019t have to say it. Put K. 595 on the gramophone and say it for me.",

Mozart make me begin to see ghosts, or at the very least ouija-boards. If you read Beethoven\u2019s letters you feel that you are at the heart of a tempest, a whirlwind, a furnace; and so you should, because you are. If you read Wagner\u2019s, you feel that you have been run over by a tank, and that, too, is an appropriate response.\n\nBut if you read Mozart\u2019s -and he was a hugely prolific letter-writer-you have no clue at all to the power that drove him and the music it squeezed out of him in such profusion that death alone could stop it; they reveal nothing-nothing that explains it. Of course it is absurd \uff08though the mistake is frequently made\uff09 to seek external causes for particular works of music; but with Mozart it is also absurd, or at any rate useless, to seek for internal ones either. Mozart was an instrument. But who was playing it?\n\nThat is what I mean by the Mozart Problem and the anxiety it causes me. In all art, in anything, there is nothing like the perfection of Mozart, nothing to compare with the range of feeling he explores, nothing to equal the contrast between the simplicity of the materials and the complexity and effect of his use of them. The piano concertos themselves exhibit these truths at their most intense; he was a greater master of this form than of the symphony itself, and to hear every one of them, in the astounding abundance of genius they provide, played as I have so recently heard them played, is to be brought face to face with a mystery which, if we could solve it, would solve the mystery of life itself.\n\nWe can see Mozart, from infant prodigy to unmarked grave. We know what he did, what he wrote, what he felt, whom he loved, where he went, what he died of. We pile up such knowledge as a child does bricks; and then we hear the little tripping rondo tune of the last concerto-and the bricks collapse; all our knowledge is useless to explain a single bar of it. It is almost enough to make me believe in-but I have run out of space, and don\u2019t have to say it. Put K. 595 on the gramophone and say it for me.",

        "\u201cThe language of a composer\u201d, Cardus wrote, \u201chis harmonies, rhythms, melodies, colors and texture, cannot be separated except bypedantic analysis from the mind and sensibility of the artist who happens to be expressing himself through them\u201d.\n\nBut that is precisely the trouble; for as far as I can see, Mozart\u2019s can. Mozart make me begin to see ghosts, or at the very least ouija-boards. If you read Beethoven\u2019s letters you feel that you are at the heart of a tempest, a whirlwind, a furnace; and so you should, because you are. If you read Wagner\u2019s, you feel that you have been run over by a tank, and that, too, is an appropriate response.\n\nBut if you read Mozart\u2019s -and he was a hugely prolific letter-writer-you have no clue at all to the power that drove him and the music it squeezed out of him in such profusion that death alone could stop it; they reveal nothing-nothing that explains it. Of course it is absurd \uff08though the mistake is frequently made\uff09 to seek external causes for particular works of music; but with Mozart it is also absurd, or at any rate useless, to seek for internal ones either. Mozart was an instrument. But who was playing it?\n\nThat is what I mean by the Mozart Problem and the anxiety it causes me. In all art, in anything, there is nothing like the perfection of Mozart, nothing to compare with the range of feeling he explores, nothing to equal the contrast between the simplicity of the materials and the complexity and effect of his use of them. The piano concertos themselves exhibit these truths at their most intense; he was a greater master of this form than of the symphony itself, and to hear every one of them, in the astounding abundance of genius they provide, played as I have so recently heard them played, is to be brought face to face with a mystery which, if we could solve it, would solve the mystery of life itself.\n\nWe can see Mozart, from infant prodigy to unmarked grave. We know what he did, what he wrote, what he felt, whom he loved, where he went, what he died of. We pile up such knowledge as a child does bricks; and then we hear the little tripping rondo tune of the last concerto-and the bricks collapse; all our knowledge is useless to explain a single bar of it. It is almost enough to make me believe in-but I have run out of space, and don\u2019t have to say it. Put K. 595 on the gramophone and say it for me.",

        "One time while on his walk George met Mr. Cattanzara coming home very late from work. He wondered if he was drunk but then could tell he wasn\u2019t. Mr. Cattanzara, a stocky, bald-headed man who worked in a change booth on an IRT station, lived on the next block after George\u2019s, above a shoe repair store. Nights, during the hot weather, he sat on his stoop in an undershirt, reading the New York Times in the light of the shoemaker\u2019s window. He read it from the first page to the last, then went up to sleep. And all the time he was reading the paper, his wife, a fat woman with a white face, leaned out of the window, gazing into the street, her thick white arms folded under her loose breast, on the window ledge.\nOnce in a while Mr. Cattanzara came home drunk, but it was a quiet drunk. He never made any trouble, only walked stiffly up the street and slowly climbed the stairs into the hall. Though drunk he looked the same as always, except for his tight walk, the quietness, and that his eyes were wet. George liked Mr. Cattanzara because he remembered him giving him nickels to buy lemon ice with when he was a squirt. Mr. Cattanzara was a different type than those in the neighbourhood. He asked different questions than the others when he met you, and he seemed to know what went on in all the newspapers. He read them, as his fat sick wife watched from the window.\n\u201cWhat are you doing with yourself this summer, George?\u201d Mr. Cattanzara asked. \u201cI see you walkin\u2019 around at night.\u201d\nGeorge felt embarrassed. \u201cI like to walk.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you doin\u2019 in the day now?\u201d\n\u201cNothing much just now. I\u2019m waiting for a job.\u201d Since it shamed him to admit that he wasn\u2019t working, George said, \u201cI\u2019m reading a lot to pick up my education.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you readin\u2019?\u201d\nGeorge hesitated, then said, \u201cI got a list of books in the library once and now I\u2019m gonna read them this summer.\u201d He felt strange and a little unhappy saying this, but he wanted Mr. Cattanzara to respect him.\n\u201cHow many books are there on it?\u201d\n\u201cI never counted them. Maybe around a hundred.\u201d\nMr. Cattanzara whistled through his teeth.\n\u201cI figure if I did that,\u201d George went on earnestly, \u201cit would help me in my education. I don\u2019t mean the kind they give you in high school. I want to know different things than they learn there, if you know what I mean.\u201d\nThe change maker nodded. \u201cStill and all, one hundred books is a pretty big load for one summer.\u201d\n\u201cIt might take longer.\u201d\n\u201cAfter you\u2019re finished with some, maybe you and I can shoot the breeze about them?\u201d said Mr. Cattanzara.\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m finished,\u201d George answered.\nMr. Cattanzara went home and George continued on his walk. After that, though he had the urge to, George did nothing different from usual. He still took his walks at night, ending up in the little park. But one evening the shoemaker on the next block stopped George to say he was a good boy, and George figured that Mr. Cattanzara had told him all about the books he was reading. From the shoemaker it must have gone down the street, because George saw a couple of people smiling kindly at him, though nobody spoke to him personally. He felt a little better around the neighbourhood and liked it more, though not so much he would want to live in it forever. He had never exactly disliked the people in it, yet he had never liked them very much either. It was the fault of the neighbourhood. To his surprise, George found out that his father and his sister Sophie knew about his reading too. His father was too shy to say anything about it\u2014he was never much of a talker in his whole life\u2014but Sophie was softer to George, and she showed him in other ways she was proud of him.",

And you don\u2019t have to be a Lincoln enthusiast to believe that this is something we can\u2019t afford to lose.\nCompare this year\u2019s celebration with the Lincoln centennial, in 1909. That year, Lincoln\u2019s likeness made its debut on the penny, thanks to approval from the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. Communities and civic associations in every corner of the country erupted in parades, concerts, balls, lectures, and military displays. We still feel the effects today: The momentum unloosed in 1909 led to the Lincoln Memorial, opened in 1922, and the Lincoln Highway, the first paved transcontinental thoroughfare.\nThe celebrants in 1909 had a few inspirations we lack today. Lincoln\u2019s presidency was still a living memory for countless Americans. In 2009 we are farther in time from the end of the Second World War than they were from the Civil War; families still felt the loss of loved ones from that awful national trauma.\nBut Americans in 1909 had something more: an unembarrassed appreciation for heroes and an acute sense of the way that even long-dead historical figures press in on the present and make us who we are.\nOne story will illustrate what I\u2019m talking about.\nIn 2003 a group of local citizens arranged to place a statue of Lincoln in Richmond, Virginia, former capital of the Confederacy. The idea touched off a firestorm of controversy. The Sons of Confederate Veterans held a public conference of carefully selected scholars to \u201creassess\u201d the legacy of Lincoln. The verdict\u2014no surprise\u2014was negative: Lincoln was labeled everything from a racist totalitarian to a teller of dirty jokes.\nI covered the conference as a reporter, but what really unnerved me was a counter-conference of scholars to refute the earlier one. These scholars drew a picture of Lincoln that only our touchy-feely age could conjure up. The man who oversaw the most savage war in our history was described\u2014by his admirers, remembers\u2014as \u201cnonjudgmental,\u201d \u201cunmoralistic,\u201d \u201ccomfortable with ambiguity.\u201d\nI felt the way a friend of mine felt as we later watched the unveiling of the Richmond statue in a subdued ceremony: \u201cBut he\u2019s so small!\u201d\nThe statue in Richmond was indeed small; like nearly every Lincoln statue put up in the past half century, it was life-size and was placed at ground level, a conscious rejection of the heroic\u2014approachable and human, yes, but not something to look up to.\nThe Richmond episode taught me that Americans have lost the language to explain Lincoln\u2019s greatness even to ourselves. Earlier generations said they wanted their children to be like Lincoln: principled, kind, compassionate, resolute. Today we want Lincoln to be like us.\nThis helps to explain the long string of recent books in which writers have presented a Lincoln made after their own image. We\u2019ve had Lincoln as humorist and Lincoln as manic-depressive, Lincoln the business sage, the conservative Lincoln and the liberal Lincoln, the emancipator and the racist, the stoic philosopher, the Christian, the atheist\u2014Lincoln over easy and Lincoln scrambled.\nWhat\u2019s often missing, though, is the timeless Lincoln, the Lincoln whom all generations, our own no less than that of 1909, can lay claim to. Lucky for us, those memorializers from a century ago\u2014and, through them, Lincoln himself\u2014have left us a hint of where to find him. The Lincoln Memorial is the most visited of our presidential monuments. Here is where we find the Lincoln who endures: in the words he left us, defining the country we\u2019ve inherited.

        "Abraham Lincoln turns 200 this year, and he\u2019s beginning to show his age. When his birthday arrives, on February 12, Congress will hold a special joint session in the Capitol\u2019s National Statuary Hall, a wreath will be laid at the great memorial in Washington, and a webcast will link school classrooms for a \u201cteach-in\u201d honouring his memory.\nAdmirable as they are, though, the events will strike many of us Lincoln fans as inadequate, even halfhearted\u2014and another sign that our appreciation for the 16th president and his towering achievements is slipping away. And you don\u2019t have to be a Lincoln enthusiast to believe that this is something we can\u2019t afford to lose.\nCompare this year\u2019s celebration with the Lincoln centennial, in 1909. That year, Lincoln\u2019s likeness made its debut on the penny, thanks to approval from the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. Communities and civic associations in every corner of the country erupted in parades, concerts, balls, lectures, and military displays. We still feel the effects today: The momentum unloosed in 1909 led to the Lincoln Memorial, opened in 1922, and the Lincoln Highway, the first paved transcontinental thoroughfare.\nThe celebrants in 1909 had a few inspirations we lack today. Lincoln\u2019s presidency was still a living memory for countless Americans. In 2009 we are farther in time from the end of the Second World War than they were from the Civil War; families still felt the loss of loved ones from that awful national trauma.\nBut Americans in 1909 had something more: an unembarrassed appreciation for heroes and an acute sense of the way that even long-dead historical figures press in on the present and make us who we are.\nOne story will illustrate what I\u2019m talking about.\nIn 2003 a group of local citizens arranged to place a statue of Lincoln in Richmond, Virginia, former capital of the Confederacy. The idea touched off a firestorm of controversy. The Sons of Confederate Veterans held a public conference of carefully selected scholars to \u201creassess\u201d the legacy of Lincoln. The verdict\u2014no surprise\u2014was negative: Lincoln was labeled everything from a racist totalitarian to a teller of dirty jokes.\nI covered the conference as a reporter, but what really unnerved me was a counter-conference of scholars to refute the earlier one. These scholars drew a picture of Lincoln that only our touchy-feely age could conjure up. The man who oversaw the most savage war in our history was described\u2014by his admirers, remembers\u2014as \u201cnonjudgmental,\u201d \u201cunmoralistic,\u201d \u201ccomfortable with ambiguity.\u201d\nI felt the way a friend of mine felt as we later watched the unveiling of the Richmond statue in a subdued ceremony: \u201cBut he\u2019s so small!\u201d\nThe statue in Richmond was indeed small; like nearly every Lincoln statue put up in the past half century, it was life-size and was placed at ground level, a conscious rejection of the heroic\u2014approachable and human, yes, but not something to look up to.\nThe Richmond episode taught me that Americans have lost the language to explain Lincoln\u2019s greatness even to ourselves.

A pair of running shoes? 1,247 gallons.\nUntil last fall, I\u2019d been oblivious to my \u201cwater footprint\u201d, which is defined as the total volume of freshwater that is used to produce goods and services, according to the Water Footprint Network. The Dutch nonprofit has been working to raise awareness of freshwater scarcity since 2008, but it was through the \u201cGreen Blue Book\u201d by Thomas M. Kostigen that I was able to see how my own actions factored in.\nI\u2019ve installed gray-water systems to reuse the wastewater from my laundry machine and bathtub and reroute it to my landscape\u2014systems that save, on average, 50 gallons of water per day. I\u2019ve set up rain barrels and infiltration pits to collect thousands of gallons of storm water cascading from my roof. I\u2019ve even entered the last bastion of greendom\u2014 installing a composting toilet.\nSuffice to say, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty satisfied with myself for all the drinking water I\u2019ve saved with these big-ticket projects.\nNow I realize that my daily consumption choices could have an even larger effect\u2014not only on the local water supply but also globally: 1.1 billion people have no access to freshwater, and, in the future, those who do have access will have less of it.\nTo see how much virtual water I was using, I logged on to the \u201cGreen Blue Book\u201d website and used its water footprint calculator, entering my daily consumption habits. Tallying up the water footprint of my breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks, as well as my daily dose of over-the-counter uppers and downers\u2014coffee, wine and beer\u2014I\u2019m using 512 gallons of virtual water each day just to feed myself.\nIn a word: alarming.\nEven more alarming was how much hidden water I was using to get dressed. I\u2019m hardly a clotheshorse, but the few new items I buy once again trumped the amount of water flowing from my faucets each day. If I\u2019m serious about saving water, I realized I could make some simple lifestyle shifts. Looking more closely at the areas in my life that use the most virtual water, it was food and clothes, specifically meat, coffee and, oddly, blue jeans and leather jackets.\nBeing a motorcyclist, I own an unusually large amount of leather\u2014boots and jackets in particular. All of it is enormously water intensive. It takes 7,996 gallons to make a leather jacket, leather being a byproduct of beef. It takes 2,866 gallons of water to make a single pair of blue jeans, because they\u2019re made from water-hogging cotton.\nCrunching the numbers for the amount of clothes I buy every year, it looks a lot like my friend\u2019s swimming pool. My entire closet is borderline Olympic.\nGulp.\nMy late resolution is to buy some items used. Underwear and socks are, of course, exempt from this strategy, but I have no problem shopping less and also shopping at Goodwill. In fact, I\u2019d been doing that for the past year to save money. My clothes\u2019 outrageous water footprint just reinforced it for me.\nMore conscious living and substitution, rather than sacrifice, are the prevailing ideas with the water footprint.

Major league baseball players, fraternity members, veterans groups, high school and college graduates, and former Boy Scouts all hold reunions on a regular basis. In addition, family reunions frequently attract blood relatives from faraway places who spend considerable money and time to reunite.\nActually, in their affection for reuniting with friends, family or colleagues, Americans are probably no different from any other people, except that Americans have created a mind-boggling number and variety of institutionalized forms of gatherings to facilitate the satisfaction of this desire. Indeed, reunions have increasingly become formal events that are organized on a regular basis and, in the process, they have also becomebig business.\nShell Norris of Class Reunion, Inc., says that Chicago alone has 1,500 high school reunions each year. A conservative estimate on the national level would be 10,000 annually. At one time, all high school reunions were organized by volunteers, usually female homemakers. In the last few years, however, as more and more women have entered the labour force, alumni reunions are increasingly being planned by specialized companies rather than by part-time volunteers.\nThe first college reunion was held by the alumni of Yale University in 1792.

At Princeton, alumni parade through the town wearing their class uniforms and singing their alma mater. At Marietta College, they gather for a dinner-dance on a steamship cruising the Ohio River.\nClearly, the thought of cruising on a steamship or marching through the streets is usually not, by itself, sufficient reason for large numbers of alumni to return to campus. Alumni who decide to attend their reunions share a common identity based on the years they spent together as undergraduates. For this reason, universities that somehow establish a common bond\u2014for example, because they are relatively small or especially prestigious\u2014tend to draw substantial numbers of their alumni to reunions.

        "In her novel of \u201cReunion, American Style\u201d, Rona Jaffe suggests that a class reunion \u201cis more than a sentimental journey. It is also a way of answering the question that lies at the back of nearly all our minds. Did they do better than I?\u201d\nJaffe\u2019s observation may be misplaced but not completely lost. According to a study conducted by social psychologist Jack Sparacino, the overwhelming majority who attend reunions aren\u2019t there invidiously to compare their recent accomplishments with those of their former classmates. Instead, they hope, primarily, to relive their earlier successes.\nCertainly, a few return to show their former classmates how well they have done; others enjoy observing the changes that have occurred in their classmates (not always in themselves, of course). But the majority who attend their class reunions do so to relive the good times they remember having when they were younger. In his study, Sparacino found that, as high school students, attendees had been more popular, more often regarded as attractive, and more involved in extracurricular activities than those classmates who chose not to attend. For those who turned up at their reunions, then, the old times were also the good times!\nIt would appear that Americans have a special fondness for reunions, judging by their prevalence. Major league baseball players, fraternity members, veterans groups, high school and college graduates, and former Boy Scouts all hold reunions on a regular basis.

        "One time while on his walk George met Mr. Cattanzara coming home very late from work. He wondered if he was drunk but then could tell he wasn\u2019t. Mr. Cattanzara, a stocky, bald-headed man who worked in a change booth on an IRT station, lived on the next block after George\u2019s, above a shoe repair store. Nights, during the hot weather, he sat on his stoop in an undershirt, reading the New York Times in the light of the shoemaker\u2019s window. He read it from the first page to the last, then went up to sleep. And all the time he was reading the paper, his wife, a fat woman with a white face, leaned out of the window, gazing into the street, her thick white arms folded under her loose breast, on the window ledge.\nOnce in a while Mr. Cattanzara came home drunk, but it was a quiet drunk. He never made any trouble, only walked stiffly up the street and slowly climbed the stairs into the hall. Though drunk he looked the same as always, except for his tight walk, the quietness, and that his eyes were wet. George liked Mr. Cattanzara because he remembered him giving him nickels to buy lemon ice with when he was a squirt. Mr. Cattanzara was a different type than those in the neighbourhood. He asked different questions than the others when he met you, and he seemed to know what went on in all the newspapers. He read them, as his fat sick wife watched from the window.\n\u201cWhat are you doing with yourself this summer, George?\u201d Mr. Cattanzara asked. \u201cI see you walkin\u2019 around at night.\u201d\nGeorge felt embarrassed. \u201cI like to walk.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you doin\u2019 in the day now?\u201d\n\u201cNothing much just now.

Maybe around a hundred.\u201d\nMr. Cattanzara whistled through his teeth.\n\u201cI figure if I did that,\u201d George went on earnestly, \u201cit would help me in my education. I don\u2019t mean the kind they give you in high school. I want to know different things than they learn there, if you know what I mean.\u201d\nThe change maker nodded. \u201cStill and all, one hundred books is a pretty big load for one summer.\u201d\n\u201cIt might take longer.\u201d\n\u201cAfter you\u2019re finished with some, maybe you and I can shoot the breeze about them?\u201d said Mr. Cattanzara.\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m finished,\u201d George answered.\nMr. Cattanzara went home and George continued on his walk. After that, though he had the urge to, George did nothing different from usual. He still took his walks at night, ending up in the little park. But one evening the shoemaker on the next block stopped George to say he was a good boy, and George figured that Mr. Cattanzara had told him all about the books he was reading. From the shoemaker it must have gone down the street, because George saw a couple of people smiling kindly at him, though nobody spoke to him personally. He felt a little better around the neighbourhood and liked it more, though not so much he would want to live in it forever. He had never exactly disliked the people in it, yet he had never liked them very much either. It was the fault of the neighbourhood. To his surprise, George found out that his father and his sister Sophie knew about his reading too.

        "If you want to know why Denmark is the world\u2019s leader in wind power, start with a three-hour car trip from the capital Copenhagen\u2014mind the bicyclists\u2014to the small town of Lem on the far west coast of Jutland. You\u2019ll feel it as you cross the 6.8 km-long Great Belt Bridge: Denmark\u2019s bountiful wind, so fierce even on a calm summer\u2019s day that it threatens to shove your car into the waves below. But wind itself is only part of the reason. In Lem, workers in factories the size of aircraft hangars build the wind turbines sold by Vestas, the Danish company that has emerged as the industry\u2019s top manufacturer around the globe. The work is both gross and fine; employees weld together massive curved sheets of steel to make central shafts as tall as a 14-story building, and assemble engine housings(\u673a\u5668\u5916\u7f69) that hold some 18, 000 separate parts. Most impressive are the turbine\u2019s blades, which scoop the wind with each sweeping revolution. As smooth as an Olympic swimsuit and honed to aerodynamic perfection, each blade weighs in at 7,000 kg, and they\u2019re what help make Vestas\u2019 turbines the best in the world. \u201cThe blade is where the secret is,\u201d says Erik Therkelsen, a Vestas executive. \u201cIf we can make a turbine, it\u2019s sold.\u201d\nBut technology, like the wind itself, is just one more part of the reason for Denmark\u2019s dominance. In the end, it happened because Denmark had the political and public will to decide that it wanted to be a leader\u2014and to follow through. Beginning in 1979, the government began a determined programme of subsidies and loan guarantees to build up its wind industry. Copenhagen covered 30% of investment costs, and guaranteed loans for large turbine exporters such as Vestas. It also mandated that utilities purchase wind energy at a preferential price\u2014thus guaranteeing investors a customer base. Energy taxes were channeled into research centers, where engineers crafted designs that would eventually produce cutting-edge giants like Vestas\u2019 3-magawatt (MW) V90 turbine.\nAs a result, wind turbines now dot Denmark. The country gets more than 19% of its electricity from the breeze (Spain and Portugal, the next highest countries, get about 10%) and Danish companies control one-third of the global wind market, earning billions in exports and creating a national champion from scratch. \u201cThey were out early in driving renewable, and that gave them the chance to be a technology leader and a job-creation leader,\u201d says Jake Schmidt, international climate policy director for the New York City-based Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cThey have always been one or two steps ahead of others.\u201d\nThe challenge now for Denmark is to help the rest of the world catch up. Beyond wind, the country (pop.5.5 million) is a world leader in energy efficiency, getting more GDP per watt than any other member of the E.U. Carbon emissions are down 13.3% from 1990 levels and total energy consumption has barely moved, even as Denmark\u2019s economy continued to grow at a healthy clip. With Copenhagen set to host all-important U.N. climate change talks in December\u2014where the world hopes for a successor to the expiring Kyoto Protocol\u2014and the global recession beginning to hit environmental plans in capitals everywhere, Denmark\u2019s example couldn\u2019t be more timely. \u201cWe\u2019ll try to make Denmark a showroom,\u201d says Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen. \u201cYou can reduce energy use and carbon emissions, and achieve economic growth.\u201d\nIt\u2019s tempting to assume that Denmark is innately green, with the kind of Scandinavian good conscience that has made it such a pleasant global citizen since, oh, the world Viking thing. But the country\u2019s policies were actually born from a different emotion, one now in common currency: fear. When the 1973 oil crisis hit, 90% of Denmark\u2019s energy came from petroleum, almost all of it imported. Buffeted by the same supply shocks that hit the rest of the developed world, Denmark launched a rapid drive for energy conservation, to the point of introducing car-free Sundays and asking businesses to switch off lights during closing hours. Eventually the Mideast oil started flowing again, and the Danes themselves began enjoying the benefits of the petroleum and natural gas in their slice of the North Sea. It was enough to make them more than self-sufficient. But unlike most other countries, Denmark never forgot the lessons of 1973, and kept driving for greater energy efficiency and a more diversified energy supply. The Danish parliament raised taxes on energy to encourage conservation and established subsidies and standards to support more efficient buildings. \u201cIt all started out without any regard for the climate or the environment,\u201d says Svend Auken, the former head of Denmark\u2019s opposition Social Democrat Party and the architect of the country\u2019s environmental policies in the 1990s. \u201cBut today there\u2019s a consensus that we need to build renewable power.\u201d\nTo the rest of the world, Denmark has the power of its example, showing that you can stay rich and grow green at the same time. \u201cDenmark has proven that acting on climate can be a positive experience, not just painful,\u201d says NRDC\u2019s Schmidt. The real pain could come from failing to follow in their footsteps.",

Everything changed in 1833 when the first mass-audience newspaper, The New York Sun, pioneered the use of advertising to reduce the cost of news, thus giving advertisers access to a wider audience. The penny press, followed by radio and television, turned news from a two-way conversation into a one-way broadcast, with a relatively small number of firms controlling the media.\nNow, the news industry is returning to something closer to the coffee house. The Internet is making news more participatory, social and diverse, reviving the discursive characteristics of the era before the mass media. That will have profound effects on society and politics. In much of the world, the mass media are flourishing. Newspaper circulation rose globally by 6% between 2005 and 2009. But those global figures mask a sharp decline in readership in rich countries.\nOver the past decade, throughout the Western world, people have been giving up newspapers and TV news and keeping up with events in profoundly different ways. Most strikingly, ordinary people are increasingly involved in compiling, sharing, filtering, discussing and distributing news. Twitter lets people anywhere report what they are seeing. Classified documents are published in their thousands online. Mobile-phone footage of Arab uprisings and American tornadoes is posted on social-networking sites and shown on television newscasts. Social-networking sites help people find, discuss and share news with their friends.\nAnd it is not just readers who are challenging the media elite. Technology firms including Google, Facebook and Twitter have become important conduits of news. Celebrities and world leaders publish updates directly via social networks; many countries now make raw data available through \u201copen government\u201d initiatives.

The transformation of the news business is unstoppable, and attempts to reverse it are doomed to failure. As producers of new journalism, individuals can be scrupulous with facts and transparent with their sources. As consumers, they can be general in their tastes and demanding in their standards.

It gives off a whiff of 19th-century decadence. Probably as much as any hotel in Paris, this hotel is sexy. I was standing facing the revolving doors and the driveway beyond. A car with a woman in the back seat\u2014a woman in a short skirt and black-leather jacket\u2014pulled up before the hotel door. She swung off and she was wearing high heels. Normally, my mind would have leaped and imagined a story for this woman. Now it didn\u2019t. I stood there and told myself. Cheer up. You\u2019re in Paris.\nIn many ways, Paris is best visited in winter. The tourist crowds are at a minimum, and one is not being jammed off the narrow sidewalks along the Rue Dauphine. More than this, Paris is like many other European cities in that the season of blockbuster cultural events tends to begin in mid-to late fall and so, by the time of winter, most of the cultural treasures of the city are laid out to be admired.\nThe other great reason why Paris in winter is so much better than Paris in spring and fall is that after the end of the August holidays and the return of chic Parisian women to their city, the restaurant-opening season truly begins hopping. By winter, many of the new restaurants have worked out their kinks(\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u56f0\u96be) and, once the hype has died down, it is possible to see which restaurants are actually good and which are merely noisy and crowded.\nMost people are about as happy as they set their mind to being, Lincoln said. In Paris it doesn\u2019t take much to be happy. Outside the hotel, the sky was pale and felt very high up. I walked the few blocks to the Seine and began running along the blue-green river toward the Eiffel Tower. The tower in the distance was black, and felt strange and beautiful the way that many things built for the joy of building do. As I ran toward it, because of its lattice structure, the tower seemed obviously delicate. Seeing it, I felt a sense of protectiveness.\nI think it was this moment of protectiveness that marked the change in my mood and my slowly becoming thrilled with being in Paris.\nDuring winter evenings, Paris\u2019s streetlamps have a halo and resemble dandelions. In winter, when one leaves the Paris street and enters a caf\u00e9 or restaurant, the light and temperature change suddenly and dramatically, there is the sense of having discovered something secret. In winter, because the days are short, there is an urgency to the choices one makes. There is the sense that life is short and so let us decide on what matters.",

        "If you want to know why Denmark is the world\u2019s leader in wind power, start with a three-hour car trip from the capital Copenhagen\u2014mind the bicyclists\u2014to the small town of Lem on the far west coast of Jutland. You\u2019ll feel it as you cross the 6.8 km-long Great Belt Bridge: Denmark\u2019s bountiful wind, so fierce even on a calm summer\u2019s day that it threatens to shove your car into the waves below. But wind itself is only part of the reason. In Lem, workers in factories the size of aircraft hangars build the wind turbines sold by Vestas, the Danish company that has emerged as the industry\u2019s top manufacturer around the globe. The work is both gross and fine; employees weld together massive curved sheets of steel to make central shafts as tall as a 14-story building, and assemble engine housings(\u673a\u5668\u5916\u7f69) that hold some 18, 000 separate parts. Most impressive are the turbine\u2019s blades, which scoop the wind with each sweeping revolution. As smooth as an Olympic swimsuit and honed to aerodynamic perfection, each blade weighs in at 7,000 kg, and they\u2019re what help make Vestas\u2019 turbines the best in the world. \u201cThe blade is where the secret is,\u201d says Erik Therkelsen, a Vestas executive. \u201cIf we can make a turbine, it\u2019s sold.\u201d\nBut technology, like the wind itself, is just one more part of the reason for Denmark\u2019s dominance. In the end, it happened because Denmark had the political and public will to decide that it wanted to be a leader\u2014and to follow through. Beginning in 1979, the government began a determined programme of subsidies and loan guarantees to build up its wind industry. Copenhagen covered 30% of investment costs, and guaranteed loans for large turbine exporters such as Vestas. It also mandated that utilities purchase wind energy at a preferential price\u2014thus guaranteeing investors a customer base. Energy taxes were channeled into research centers, where engineers crafted designs that would eventually produce cutting-edge giants like Vestas\u2019 3-magawatt (MW) V90 turbine.\nAs a result, wind turbines now dot Denmark. The country gets more than 19% of its electricity from the breeze (Spain and Portugal, the next highest countries, get about 10%) and Danish companies control one-third of the global wind market, earning billions in exports and creating a national champion from scratch. \u201cThey were out early in driving renewable, and that gave them the chance to be a technology leader and a job-creation leader,\u201d says Jake Schmidt, international climate policy director for the New York City-based Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cThey have always been one or two steps ahead of others.\u201d\nThe challenge now for Denmark is to help the rest of the world catch up. Beyond wind, the country (pop.5.5 million) is a world leader in energy efficiency, getting more GDP per watt than any other member of the E.U. Carbon emissions are down 13.3% from 1990 levels and total energy consumption has barely moved, even as Denmark\u2019s economy continued to grow at a healthy clip. With Copenhagen set to host all-important U.N. climate change talks in December\u2014where the world hopes for a successor to the expiring Kyoto Protocol\u2014and the global recession beginning to hit environmental plans in capitals everywhere, Denmark\u2019s example couldn\u2019t be more timely. \u201cWe\u2019ll try to make Denmark a showroom,\u201d says Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen. \u201cYou can reduce energy use and carbon emissions, and achieve economic growth.\u201d\nIt\u2019s tempting to assume that Denmark is innately green, with the kind of Scandinavian good conscience that has made it such a pleasant global citizen since, oh, the world Viking thing. But the country\u2019s policies were actually born from a different emotion, one now in common currency: fear. When the 1973 oil crisis hit, 90% of Denmark\u2019s energy came from petroleum, almost all of it imported. Buffeted by the same supply shocks that hit the rest of the developed world, Denmark launched a rapid drive for energy conservation, to the point of introducing car-free Sundays and asking businesses to switch off lights during closing hours. Eventually the Mideast oil started flowing again, and the Danes themselves began enjoying the benefits of the petroleum and natural gas in their slice of the North Sea. It was enough to make them more than self-sufficient. But unlike most other countries, Denmark never forgot the lessons of 1973, and kept driving for greater energy efficiency and a more diversified energy supply. The Danish parliament raised taxes on energy to encourage conservation and established subsidies and standards to support more efficient buildings. \u201cIt all started out without any regard for the climate or the environment,\u201d says Svend Auken, the former head of Denmark\u2019s opposition Social Democrat Party and the architect of the country\u2019s environmental policies in the 1990s. \u201cBut today there\u2019s a consensus that we need to build renewable power.\u201d\nTo the rest of the world, Denmark has the power of its example, showing that you can stay rich and grow green at the same time. \u201cDenmark has proven that acting on climate can be a positive experience, not just painful,\u201d says NRDC\u2019s Schmidt. The real pain could come from failing to follow in their footsteps.",

        "Speaking two languages rather than just one has obvious practical benefits in an increasingly globalized world. But in recent years, scientists have begun to show that the advantages of bilingualism are even more fundamental than being able to converse with a wider range of people. Being bilingual, it turned out, makes you smarter. It can have a profound effect on your brain, improving cognitive skills not related to language and even shielding against dementia(\u75f4\u5446) in old age.\nThis view of bilingualism is remarkably different from the understanding of bilingualism through much of the 20th century. Researchers, educators and policy makers long considered a second language to be an interference, cognitively speaking, that hindered a child\u2019s academic and intellectual development.\nThey were not wrong about the interference: there is ample evidence that in a bilingual\u2019s brain both language systems are active even when he is using only one language, thus creating situations in which one system obstructs the other. But this interference, researchers are finding out, isn\u2019t so much a handicap as a blessing in disguise. It forces the brain to resolve internal conflict, giving the mind a workout that strengthens its cognitive muscles.\nThe collective evidence from a number of such studies suggests that the bilingual experience improves the brain\u2019s so-called executive function\u2014a command system that directs the attention processes that we use for planning, solving problems and performing various other mentally demanding tasks. These processes include ignoring distractions to stay focused, switching attention willfully from one thing to another and holding information in mind\u2014like remembering a sequence of directions while driving.\nWhy does the tussle between two simultaneously active language systems improve these aspects of cognition? Until recently, researchers thought the bilingual advantage stemmed primarily from an ability for inhibition that was honed by the exercise of suppressing one language system: this suppression, it was thought, would help train the bilingual mind to ignore distractions in other contexts. But that explanation increasingly appears to be inadequate, since studies have shown that bilinguals perform better than monolinguals even at tasks that do not require inhibition, like threading a line through an ascending series of numbers scattered randomly on a page.\nThe key difference between bilinguals and monolinguals may be more basic: a heightened ability to monitor the environment. \u201cBilinguals have to switch languages quite often\u2014you may talk to your father in one language and to your mother in another language,\u201d says Albert Costa, a researcher at the University of Pompea Fabra in Spain. \u201cIt requires keeping track of changes around you in the same way that we monitor our surroundings when driving.\u201d In a study comparing German-Italian bilinguals with Italian monolinguals in completing monitoring tasks, Mr. Costa and his colleagues found that the bilingual subjects not only performed better, but also did so with less activity in parts of the brain involved in monitoring, indicating that they were efficient at it.\nThe bilingual experience appears to influence the brain from infancy to old age, and there is reason to believe that it may also apply to those who learn a second language later in life.",

But that explanation increasingly appears to be inadequate, since studies have shown that bilinguals perform better than monolinguals even at tasks that do not require inhibition, like threading a line through an ascending series of numbers scattered randomly on a page.\nThe key difference between bilinguals and monolinguals may be more basic: a heightened ability to monitor the environment. \u201cBilinguals have to switch languages quite often\u2014you may talk to your father in one language and to your mother in another language,\u201d says Albert Costa, a researcher at the University of Pompea Fabra in Spain. \u201cIt requires keeping track of changes around you in the same way that we monitor our surroundings when driving.\u201d In a study comparing German-Italian bilinguals with Italian monolinguals in completing monitoring tasks, Mr. Costa and his colleagues found that the bilingual subjects not only performed better, but also did so with less activity in parts of the brain involved in monitoring, indicating that they were efficient at it.\nThe bilingual experience appears to influence the brain from infancy to old age, and there is reason to believe that it may also apply to those who learn a second language later in life.",

In each session, we look at one company through the lenses of different theories, using them to explain how the company got into its situation and to examine what actions will yield the needed results. On the last day of class, I ask my students to turn those theoretical lenses on themselves to find answers to two questions: First, How can I be sure I\u2019ll be happy in my career? Second, how can I be sure my relationships with my spouse and my family will become an enduring source of happiness?

And I have exactly the same problem that a corporation does. I have a limited amount of time, energy, and talent. How much do I devote to each of these pursuits?\nAllocation choices can make your life turn out to be very different from what you intended. Sometimes that\u2019s good: Opportunities that you never planned for emerge. But if you don\u2019t invest your resources wisely, the outcome can be bad. As I think about people who inadvertently invested in lives of hollow unhappiness, I can\u2019t help believing that their troubles relate right back to a short-term perspective.\nWhen people with a high need for achievement have an extra half hour of time or an extra ounce of energy, they\u2019ll unconsciously allocate it to activities that yield the most tangible accomplishments. Our careers provide the most concrete evidence that we\u2019re moving forward. You ship a product, finish a design, complete a presentation, close a sale, teach a class, publish a paper, get paid, and get promoted. In contrast, investing time and energy in your relationships with your spouse and children typically doesn\u2019t offer that same immediate sense of achievement. Kids misbehave every day. It\u2019s really not until 20 years down the road that you can say, \u201cI raised a good son or a good daughter.\u201d You can neglect your relationship with your spouse, and on a daily basis it doesn\u2019t seem as if things are deteriorating. People who are driven to excel have this unconscious propensity to underinvest in their families and overinvest in their careers, even though intimate and loving family relationships are the most powerful and enduring source of happiness.\nIf you study the root causes of business disasters, over and over you\u2019ll find this predisposition toward endeavors that offer immediate gratification. If you look at personal lives through that lens, you\u2019ll see the same stunning and sobering pattern: people allocating fewer and fewer resources to the things they would have once said mattered most.\n2. CREATE A FAMILY CULTURE. It\u2019s one thing to see into the foggy future with acuity and chart the course corrections a company must take. But it\u2019s quite another to persuade employees to line up and work cooperatively to take the company in that new direction.\nWhen there is little agreement, you have to use \u201cpower tools\u201d\u2014coercion, threats, punishment, and so on, to secure cooperation. But if employees\u2019 ways of working together succeed over and over, consensus begins to form. Ultimately, people don\u2019t even think about whether their way yields success. They embrace priorities and follow procedures by instinct and assumption rather than by explicit decision, which means that they\u2019ve created a culture.

And culture defines the priority given to different types of problems.

My students quickly see that the simplest way parents can elicit cooperation from children is to wield power tools. But there comes a point during the teen years when power tools no longer work. At that point, parents start wishing they had begun working with their children at a very young age to build a culture in which children instinctively behave respectfully toward one another, obey their parents, and choose the right thing to do.

        "It was nearly bedtime and when they awoke next morning land would be in sight. Dr. Macphail lit his pipe and, leaning over the rail, searched the heavens for the South Cross. After two years at the front and a wound that had taken longer to heal than it should, he was glad to settle down quietly at Apia(\u963f\u76ae\u4e9a\uff0c\u897f\u8428\u6469\u4e9a\u9996\u90fd) for twelve months at least, and he felt already better for the journey. Since some of the passengers were leaving the ship next day at Pago-Pago, they had had a little dance that evening and in his ears hammered still the harsh notes of the mechanical piano. But the deck was quiet at last. A little way off he saw his wife in a long chair talking with the Davidsons, and he strolled over to her. When he sat down under the light and took his hat you saw that he had very red hair, with a bald patch on the crown, and the red, freckled skin which accompanied red hair; he was a man of forty, thin, with a pinched face, precise and rather pedantic; and he spoke with a Scots accent in a very low, quiet voice.\nBetween the Macphails and the Davidsons, who were missionaries, there had arisen the intimacy of shipboard, which is due to proximity rather than to any community of taste. Their chief tie was the disapproval they shared of the men who spent their days and nights in the smoking-room playing poker or bridge and drinking. Mrs. Macphail was not a little flattered to think that she and her husband were the only people on board with whom the Davidsons were willing to associate, and even the doctor, shy but no fool, half unconsciously acknowledged the compliment. It was because he was of an argumentative mind that in their cabin at night he permitted himself to carp(\u5520\u53e8).\n\u2018Mrs. Davidson was saying she didn\u2019t know how they\u2019d have got through the journey if it hadn\u2019t been for us, \u2019 said Mrs. Macphail, as she neatly brushed out her transformation(\u5047\u53d1). \u2018She said we were really the only people on the ship they cared to know.\u2019\n\u2018I shouldn\u2019t have thought a missionary was such a big bug(\u8981\u4eba\uff0c\u540d\u58eb) that he could afford to put on frills(\u6446\u67b6\u5b50).\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s not frills. I quite understand what she means. It wouldn\u2019t have been very nice for the Davidsons to have to mix with all that rough lot in the smoking-room.\u2019\n\u2018The founder of their religion wasn\u2019t so exclusive,\u2019 said Dr. Macphail with a chuckle.\n\u2018I\u2019ve asked you over and over again not to joke about religion,\u2019 answered his wife. \u2018I shouldn\u2019t like to have a nature like yours, Alec. You never look for the best in people.\u2019\nHe gave her a sidelong glance with his pale, blue eyes, but did not reply. After many years of married life he had learned that it was more conducive to peace to leave his wife with the last word, He was undressed before she was, and climbing into the upper bunk he settled down to read himself to sleep.\nWhen he came on deck next morning they were close to land. He looked at it with greedy eyes. There was a thin strip of silver beach rising quickly to hills covered to the top with luxuriant vegetation. The coconut trees, thick and green, came nearly to the water\u2019s edge, and among them you saw the grass houses of the Samoans(\u8428\u6469\u4e9a\u4eba); and here and there, gleaming white, a little church. Mrs. Davidson came and stood beside him. She was dressed in black and wore round her neck a gold chain, from which dangled a cross. She was a little woman, with brown, dull hair very elaborately arranged, and she had prominent blue eyes behind invisible pince-nez(\u5939\u9f3b\u773c\u955c). Her face was long, like a sheep\u2019s, but she gave no impression of foolishness, rather of extreme alertness; she had the quick movements of a bird. The most remarkable thing about her was her voice, high, metallic, and without inflexion; it fell on the ear with a hard monotony, irritating to the nerves like the pitiless clamor of the pneumatic drill.\n\u2018This must seem like home to you,\u2019 said Dr. Macphail, with his thin, difficult smile.\n\u2018Ours are low islands, you know, not like these. Coral. These are volcanic. We\u2019ve got another ten days\u2019 journey to reach them.\u2019\n\u2018In these parts that\u2019s almost like being in the next street at home,\u2019 said Dr. Macphail facetiously.\n\u2018Well, that\u2019s rather an exaggerated way of putting it, but one does look at distances differently in the South Seas. So far you are right.\u2019\nDr. Macphail sighed faintly.",

        "Today we make room for a remarkably narrow range of personality styles. We\u2019re told that to be great is to be bold, to be happy is to be sociable. We see ourselves as a nation of extroverts\u2014which means that we\u2019ve lost sight of who we really are. One-third to one-half of Americans is introverts\u2014in other words, one out of every two or three people you know. If you\u2019re not an introvert yourself, you are surely raising, managing, married to, or coupled with one.\nIf these statistics surprise you, that\u2019s probably because so many people pretend to be extroverts. Closet introverts pass undetected on playgrounds, in high school locker rooms, and in the corridors of corporate America. Some fool even themselves, until some life event\u2014a layoff, an empty nest, an inheritance that frees them to spend time as they like\u2014jolts them into taking stock of their true natures. You have only to raise this subject with your friends and acquaintances to find that the most unlikely people consider themselves introverts.\nIt makes sense that so many introverts hide even from themselves. We live with a value system that I call the Extrovert Ideal\u2014the omnipresent belief that the ideal self is gregarious, and comfortable in the spotlight. The archetypal extrovert prefers action to contemplation, risk-taking to heed-taking, certainty to doubt. He favors quick decisions, even at the risk of being wrong. She works well in teams and socializes in groups. We like to think that we value individuality, but all too often we admire one type of individual\u2014the kind who\u2019s comfortable \u201cputting himself out there.\u201d Sure, we allow technologically gifted loners who launch companies in garages to have any personality they please, but they are the exceptions, not the rule, and our tolerance extends mainly to those who get fabulously wealthy or hold the promise of doing so.\nIntroversion\u2014along with its cousins sensitivity, seriousness, and shyness\u2014is now a second-class personality trait, somewhere between a disappointment and a pathology. Introverts living under the Extrovert Ideal are like women in a man\u2019s world, discounted because of a trait that goes to the core of who they are. Extroversion is an enormously appealing personality style, but we\u2019ve turned it into an oppressive standard to which most of us feel we must conform.\nThe Extrovert Ideal has been documented in many studies, though this research has never been grouped under a single name. Talkative people, for example, are rated as smarter, better-looking, more interesting, and more desirable as friends. Velocity of speech counts as well as volume: we rank fast talkers as more competent and likable than slow ones. Even the word introvert is stigmatized\u2014one informal study, by psychologist Laurie Helgoe, found that introverts described their own physical appearance in vivid language, but when asked to describe generic introverts they drew a bland and distasteful picture.\nBut we make a grave mistake to embrace the Extrovert Ideal so unthinkingly. Some of our greatest ideas, art, and inventions\u2014from the theory of evolution to Van Gogh\u2019s sunflowers to the personal computer\u2014came from quiet and cerebral people who knew how to tune in to their inner worlds and the treasures to be found there.",

But the lorry that arrived to take me up to the mountains was worse than anything I had seen before: it tottered on the borders of senile decay. It stood there on buckled wheels, wheezing and gasping with exhaustion from having to climb up the gentle slope to the camp, and I consigned myself and my loads to it with some fear. The driver, who was a cheerful fellow, pointed out that he would require my assistance in two very necessary operations: first, I had to keep the hand brake pressed down when travelling downhill, for unless it was held thus almost level with the floor it sullenly refused to function. Secondly, I had to keep a stern eye on the clutch, a willful piece of mechanism that seized every chance to leap out of its socket with a noise like a strangling leopard. As it was obvious that not even a West African lorry-driver could be successful in driving while crouched under the dashboard, I had to take over control of those instruments if I valued my life. So, while I ducked at intervals to put on the brake, amid the rich smell of burning rubber, our noble lorry jerked its way towards the mountains at a steady twenty miles per hour; sometimes, when a downward slope favoured it, it threw caution to the winds and careered(\u731b\u51b2) along in a reckless fashion at twenty-five.\nFor the first thirty miles the red earth road wound its way through the lowland forest, the giant trees standing in solid ranks alongside and their branches entwined(\u76d8\u7ed5) in an archway of leaves above us. Slowly and almost imperceptibly the road started to climb upwards, looping its way in languid curves round the forested hills. In the back of the lorry the boys lifted up their voices in song:\nHome again, home again,\nWhen shall I see ma home?\nThe driver hummed the refrain(\u526f\u6b4c) softly to himself glancing at me to see if I would object. To his surprise I joined in and so while the lorry rolled onwards, the boys in the back maintained the chorus while the driver and I harmonized and sang complicated bits.\nBreaks in the forest became more frequent the higher we climbed, and presently a new type of undergrowth began to appear: massive tree-ferns standing at the roadside on their thick, squat, hairy trunks. These ferns were the guardians of a new world, for suddenly, as though the hills had shrugged themselves free of a cloak, the forest disappeared. It lay behind us in the valley, while above us the hillside rose majestically, covered in a coat of waist-high grass.

We crawled to a standstill and the driver switched off the engine.\n\u201cWe must wait small-time, engine get hot,\u201d he explained, pointing to the forequarters of the lorry, which were by now completely invisible under a cloud of steam.

        "Have you ever noticed a certain similarity in public parks and back gardens in the cities of the West? A ubiquitous woodland mix of lawn grasses and trees has found its way throughout Europe and the United States, and it\u2019s now spread to other cities around the world. As ecologist Peter Groffman has noted, it\u2019s increasingly difficult to tell one suburb apart from another, even when they\u2019re located in vastly different climates such as Phoenix, Arizona, or Boston in the much chillier north-east of the US. And why do parks in New Zealand often feature the same species of trees that grow on the other side of the world in the UK?\nInspired by the English and New England countrysides, early landscape architects of the 19th century created an aesthetic for urban public and private open space that persists to this day. But in the 21st century, urban green space is tasked with doing far more than simply providing aesthetic appeal. From natural systems to deal with surface water run-off and pollution to green corridors to increasing interest in urban food production, the urban parks of the future will be designed and engineered for functionality as well as for beauty.\nImagine travelling among the cities of the mid-21st century and finding a unique set of urban landscapes that capture local beauty, natural and cultural history, and the environmental context. They are tuned to their locality, and diverse within as well as across cities. There are patches that provide shade and cooling, places of local food production, and corridors that connect both residents and wildlife to the surrounding native environment. Their functions are measured and monitored to meet the unique needs of each city for food production, water use, nutrient recycling, and habitat. No two green spaces are quite the same.\nPlanners are already starting to work towards this vision. And if this movement has a buzzword it is \u201chyperfunctionality\u201d\u2014designs which provide multiple uses in a confined space. At the moment, urban landscapes are highly managed and limited in their spatial extent. Even the \u201cgreen\u201d cities of the future will contain extensive areas of buildings, roads, railways, and other built structures. These future cities are likely to contain a higher proportion of green cover than the cities of today, with an increasing focus on planting on roofs, vertical walls, and surfaces like car parks. But built environments will still be ever-present in dense megacities. We can greatly enhance the utility of green space through designs that provide a range of different uses in a confined space. A hyperfunctional planting, for example, might be designed to provide food, shade, wildlife habitat, and pollution removal all in the same garden with the right choice of plants and management practices.\nWhat this means is that we have to maximize the benefits and uses of urban parks, while minimizing the costs of building and maintaining them. Currently, green space and street plantings are relatively similar throughout the Western world, regardless of differences in local climate, geography, and natural history. Even desert cities feature the same sizable street trees and well-watered and well-fertilized lawns that you might see in more temperate climes. The movement to reduce the resources and water requirements of such urban landscapes in these arid areas is called \u201cxeriscaping\u201d\u2014a concept that has so-far received mixed responses in terms of public acceptance. Scott Yabiku and colleagues at the Central Arizona Phoenix project showed that newcomers to the desert embrace xeriscaping more than long-time residents, who are more likely to prefer the well-watered aesthetic. In part, this may be because xeriscaping is justified more by reducing landscaping costs\u2014in this case water costs\u2014than by providing desired benefits like recreation, pollution mitigation, and cultural value. From this perspective, xeriscaping can seem more like a compromise than an asset.\nBut there are other ways to make our parks and natural spaces do more. Nan Ellin, of the Ecological Planning Center in the US, advocates an asset-based approach to urbanism. Instead of envisioning cities in terms of what they can\u2019t have, ecological planners are beginning to frame the discussion of future cities in terms of what they do have\u2014their natural and cultural assets.

        "Have you ever noticed a certain similarity in public parks and back gardens in the cities of the West? A ubiquitous woodland mix of lawn grasses and trees has found its way throughout Europe and the United States, and it\u2019s now spread to other cities around the world. As ecologist Peter Groffman has noted, it\u2019s increasingly difficult to tell one suburb apart from another, even when they\u2019re located in vastly different climates such as Phoenix, Arizona, or Boston in the much chillier north-east of the US. And why do parks in New Zealand often feature the same species of trees that grow on the other side of the world in the UK?\nInspired by the English and New England countrysides, early landscape architects of the 19th century created an aesthetic for urban public and private open space that persists to this day. But in the 21st century, urban green space is tasked with doing far more than simply providing aesthetic appeal. From natural systems to deal with surface water run-off and pollution to green corridors to increasing interest in urban food production, the urban parks of the future will be designed and engineered for functionality as well as for beauty.\nImagine travelling among the cities of the mid-21st century and finding a unique set of urban landscapes that capture local beauty, natural and cultural history, and the environmental context. They are tuned to their locality, and diverse within as well as across cities. There are patches that provide shade and cooling, places of local food production, and corridors that connect both residents and wildlife to the surrounding native environment. Their functions are measured and monitored to meet the unique needs of each city for food production, water use, nutrient recycling, and habitat. No two green spaces are quite the same.\nPlanners are already starting to work towards this vision. And if this movement has a buzzword it is \u201chyperfunctionality\u201d\u2014designs which provide multiple uses in a confined space. At the moment, urban landscapes are highly managed and limited in their spatial extent. Even the \u201cgreen\u201d cities of the future will contain extensive areas of buildings, roads, railways, and other built structures. These future cities are likely to contain a higher proportion of green cover than the cities of today, with an increasing focus on planting on roofs, vertical walls, and surfaces like car parks. But built environments will still be ever-present in dense megacities. We can greatly enhance the utility of green space through designs that provide a range of different uses in a confined space. A hyperfunctional planting, for example, might be designed to provide food, shade, wildlife habitat, and pollution removal all in the same garden with the right choice of plants and management practices.\nWhat this means is that we have to maximize the benefits and uses of urban parks, while minimizing the costs of building and maintaining them. Currently, green space and street plantings are relatively similar throughout the Western world, regardless of differences in local climate, geography, and natural history. Even desert cities feature the same sizable street trees and well-watered and well-fertilized lawns that you might see in more temperate climes. The movement to reduce the resources and water requirements of such urban landscapes in these arid areas is called \u201cxeriscaping\u201d\u2014a concept that has so-far received mixed responses in terms of public acceptance. Scott Yabiku and colleagues at the Central Arizona Phoenix project showed that newcomers to the desert embrace xeriscaping more than long-time residents, who are more likely to prefer the well-watered aesthetic. In part, this may be because xeriscaping is justified more by reducing landscaping costs\u2014in this case water costs\u2014than by providing desired benefits like recreation, pollution mitigation, and cultural value. From this perspective, xeriscaping can seem more like a compromise than an asset.\nBut there are other ways to make our parks and natural spaces do more. Nan Ellin, of the Ecological Planning Center in the US, advocates an asset-based approach to urbanism.

Both arguments are plausible. However, there is a third factor: a question of touch. We can love the look but, in an online environment, we cannot feel the quality of a texture, the shape of the fit, the fall of a fold or the weight of an earring. And physically interacting with an object makes you more committed to your purchase.\nWhen my most recent book Brandwashed was released, I teamed up with a local bookstore to conduct an experiment about the differences between the online and offline shopping. I carefully instructed a group of volunteers to promote my book in two different ways. The first was a fairly hands-off approach. Whenever a customer would inquire about my book, the volunteer would take them over to the shelf and point to it. Out of 20 such requests, six customers proceeded with the purchase.\nThe second option also involved going over to the shelf but, this time, removing the book and then subtly holding onto it for just an extra moment before placing it in the customer\u2019s hands.

I\u2019d love it if our dog could fetch the morning paper and then read it to me over coffee, but I actually care much more about her loyal and innocent heart. There\u2019s already enough thinking going on in our house, and we probably spend too much time in our heads. Where we need some role modeling is in instinct, and that\u2019s where a dog is a roving revelation.\nI did not grow up with dogs, which meant that my older daughter\u2019s respectful but unyielding determination to get one required some adjustment on my part. I often felt she was training me: from ages of 6 to 9, she gently schooled me in various breeds and their personalities, whispered to the dogs we encountered so they would charm and persuade me, demonstrated by her self-discipline that she was ready for the responsibility. And thus came our dog Twist, whom I sometimes mistake for a third daughter.\nAt first I thought the challenge would be to train her to sit, to heel, to walk calmly beside us and not go wildly chasing the neighbourhood rabbits. But I soon discovered how much more we had to learn from her than she from us.\nIf it is true, for example, that the secret to a child\u2019s success is less rare genius than raw persistence, Twist\u2019s ability to stay on task is a model for us all, especially if the task is trying to capture the sunbeam that flicks around the living room as the wind blows through the branches outside. She never succeeds, and she never gives up. This includes when she runs square into walls.\nThen there is her unfailing patience, which breaks down only when she senses that dinnertime was 15 minutes ago and we have somehow failed to notice. Even then she is more eager than indignant, and her refusal to whine shows a restraint of which I\u2019m not always capable when hungry.\nBut the lesson I value most is the one in forgiveness, and Twist first offered this when she was still very young. When she was about 7 months old, we took her to the vet to be spayed(\u5207\u9664\u5375\u5de2). We turned her over to a stranger, who proceeded to perform a procedure that was probably not pleasant. But when the vet returned her to us, limp and tender, there was no recrimination(\u53cd\u8d23), no How could you do that to me? It was as though she already knew that we would not intentionally cause her pain, and while she did not understand, she forgave and curled up with her head on my daughter\u2019s lap.\nI suppose we could have concluded that she was just blindly loyal and docile. But eventually we knew better. She is entirely capable of disobedience, as she has proved many times. She will ignore us when there are more interesting things to look at, rebuke us when we are careless, bark into the twilight when she has urgent messages to send. But her patience with our failings and fickleness and her willingness to give us a second chance are a daily lesson in gratitude.\nMy friends who grow up with dogs tell me how when they were teenagers and trusted no one in the world, they could tell their dog all their secrets. It was the one friend who would not gossip or betray, could provide in the middle of the night the soft, unbegrudging comfort and peace that adolescence conspires to disrupt. An age that is all about growth and risk needs some anchors and weights, a model of steadfastness when all else is in flux. Sometimes I think Twist\u2019s devotion keeps my girls on a benevolent leash, one that hangs quietly at their side as they trot along but occasionally yanks them back to safety and solid ground.\nWe\u2019ve weighed so many decisions so carefully in raising our daughters\u2014what school to send them to and what church to attend, when to give them cell phones and with what precautions. But when it comes to what really shapes their character and binds our family, I never would have thought we would owe so much to its smallest member.",

But the lorry that arrived to take me up to the mountains was worse than anything I had seen before: it tottered on the borders of senile decay. It stood there on buckled wheels, wheezing and gasping with exhaustion from having to climb up the gentle slope to the camp, and I consigned myself and my loads to it with some fear. The driver, who was a cheerful fellow, pointed out that he would require my assistance in two very necessary operations: first, I had to keep the hand brake pressed down when travelling downhill, for unless it was held thus almost level with the floor it sullenly refused to function. Secondly, I had to keep a stern eye on the clutch, a willful piece of mechanism that seized every chance to leap out of its socket with a noise like a strangling leopard. As it was obvious that not even a West African lorry-driver could be successful in driving while crouched under the dashboard, I had to take over control of those instruments if I valued my life. So, while I ducked at intervals to put on the brake, amid the rich smell of burning rubber, our noble lorry jerked its way towards the mountains at a steady twenty miles per hour; sometimes, when a downward slope favoured it, it threw caution to the winds and careered(\u731b\u51b2) along in a reckless fashion at twenty-five.\nFor the first thirty miles the red earth road wound its way through the lowland forest, the giant trees standing in solid ranks alongside and their branches entwined(\u76d8\u7ed5) in an archway of leaves above us. Slowly and almost imperceptibly the road started to climb upwards, looping its way in languid curves round the forested hills. In the back of the lorry the boys lifted up their voices in song:\nHome again, home again,\nWhen shall I see ma home?\nThe driver hummed the refrain(\u526f\u6b4c) softly to himself glancing at me to see if I would object. To his surprise I joined in and so while the lorry rolled onwards, the boys in the back maintained the chorus while the driver and I harmonized and sang complicated bits.\nBreaks in the forest became more frequent the higher we climbed, and presently a new type of undergrowth began to appear: massive tree-ferns standing at the roadside on their thick, squat, hairy trunks. These ferns were the guardians of a new world, for suddenly, as though the hills had shrugged themselves free of a cloak, the forest disappeared. It lay behind us in the valley, while above us the hillside rose majestically, covered in a coat of waist-high grass. The lorry crept higher and higher, the engine gasping and shuddering with this unaccustomed activity. I began to think that we should have to push the wretched thing up the last two or three hundred feet, but to everyone\u2019s surprise we made it, and the lorry crept on to the brow of the hill, trembling with fatigue, spouting steam from its radiator like a dying whale. We crawled to a standstill and the driver switched off the engine.\n\u201cWe must wait small-time, engine get hot,\u201d he explained, pointing to the forequarters of the lorry, which were by now completely invisible under a cloud of steam.

Whatever else it is, higher education is not a bastion of excellence. It is shot through with waste, lax academic standards and mediocre teaching and scholarship.\n(2) True, the economic pressures\u2014from the Ivy League to state systems\u2014are intense. Last year, nearly two-thirds of schools had to make midyear spending cuts to stay within their budgets. It is also true (as university presidents and deans argue) that relieving those pressures merely by raising tuition and cutting courses will make matters worse. Students will pay more and get less. The university presidents and deans want to be spared from further government budget cuts. Their case is weak.\n(3) Higher education is a bloated enterprise. Too many professors do too little teaching to too many ill-prepared students. Costs can be cut and quality improved without reducing the number of graduates. Many colleges and universities should shrink. Some should go out of business. Consider:\n\u00b7Except for elite schools, admission standards are low. About 70 percent of freshmen at four-year colleges and universities attend their first-choice schools. Roughly 20 percent go to their second choices. Most schools have eagerly boosted enrollments to maximize revenues (tuition and state subsidies).\n\u00b7Dropout rates are high. Half or more of freshmen don\u2019t get degrees. A recent study of PhD programs at 10 major universities also found high dropout rates for doctoral candidates.\n\u00b7The attrition among undergraduates is particularly surprising because college standards have apparently fallen. One study of seven top schools found widespread grade inflation. In 1963, half of the students in introductory philosophy courses got a B\u2014or worse. By 1986, only 20 percent did. If elite schools have relaxed standards, the practice is almost surely widespread.\n\u00b7Faculty teaching loads have fallen steadily since the 1960s. In major universities, senior faculty members often do less than two hours a day of teaching. Professors are \u201csocialized to publish, teach graduate students and spend as little time teaching (undergraduates) as possible,\u201d concludes James Fairweather of Penn State University in a new study. Faculty pay consistently rises as undergraduate teaching loads drop.\n\u00b7Universities have encouraged an almost mindless explosion of graduate degrees. Since 1960, the number of masters\u2019 degrees awarded annually has risen more than fourfold to 337,000. Between 1965 and 1989, the annual number of MBAs (masters in business administration) jumped from 7,600 to 73,100.\n(4) Even so, our system has strengths. It boasts many top-notch schools and allows almost anyone to go to college. But mediocrity is pervasive. We push as many freshmen as possible through the door, regardless of qualifications. Because bachelors\u2019 degrees are so common, we create more graduate degrees of dubious worth. Does anyone believe the MBA explosion has improved management?\n(5) You won\u2019t hear much about this from college deans or university presidents. They created this mess and are its biggest beneficiaries. Large enrollments support large faculties. More graduate students liberate tenured faculty from undergraduate teaching to concentrate on writing and research: the source of status. Richard Huber, a former college dean, writes knowingly in a new book \u201cHow Professors Play the Cat Guarding the Cream: Why We\u2019re Paying More and Getting Less in Higher Education\u201d: Presidents, deans and trustees ... call for more recognition of good teaching with prizes and salary incentives.\n(6) The reality is closer to the experience of Harvard University\u2019s distinguished paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould: \u201cTo be perfectly honest, though lip service is given to teaching, I have never seriously heard teaching considered in any meeting for promotion ... Writing is the currency of prestige and promotion.\u201d\n(7) About four-fifths of all students attend state-subsidized systems, from community colleges to prestige universities. How governors and state legislatures deal with their budget pressures will be decisive. Private schools will, for better or worse, be influenced by state actions. The states need to do three things.\n(8) First, create genuine entrance requirements. Today\u2019s low standards tell high school students: You don\u2019t have to work hard to go to college. States should change the message by raising tuitions sharply and coupling the increase with generous scholarships based on merit and income. To get scholarships, students would have to pass meaningful entrance exams. Ideally, the scholarships should be available for use at in-state private schools. All schools would then compete for students on the basis of academic quality and costs. Today\u2019s system of general tuition subsidies provides aid to well-to-do families that don\u2019t need it or to unqualified students who don\u2019t deserve it.\n(9) Next, states should raise faculty teaching loads, mainly at four-year schools. (Teaching loads at community colleges are already high.) This would cut costs and reemphasize the primacy of teaching at most schools. What we need are teachers who know their fields and can communicate enthusiasm to students. Not all professors can be path-breaking scholars. The excessive emphasis on scholarship generates many unread books and mediocre articles in academic journals. \u201cYou can\u2019t do more of one (research) without less of the other (teaching),\u201d says Fairweather. \u201cPeople are working hard\u2014it\u2019s just where they\u2019re working.\u201d\n(10) Finally, states should reduce or eliminate the least useful graduate programs. Journalism (now dubbed \u201ccommunications\u201d), business and education are prime candidates. A lot of what they teach can\u2014and should\u2014be learned on the job. If colleges and universities did a better job of teaching undergraduates, there would be less need for graduate degrees.\n(11) Our colleges and universities need to provide a better education to deserving students. This may mean smaller enrollments, but given today\u2019s attrition rates, the number of graduates need not drop. Higher education could become a bastion of excellence, if we would only try.",

Faculty pay consistently rises as undergraduate teaching loads drop.\n\u00b7Universities have encouraged an almost mindless explosion of graduate degrees. Since 1960, the number of masters\u2019 degrees awarded annually has risen more than fourfold to 337,000.

        "(1) The term \u201cCYBERSPACE\u201d was coined by William Gibson, a science-fiction writer. He first used it in a short story in 1982, and expanded on it a couple of years later in a novel, \u201cNeuromancer\u201d, whose main character, Henry Dorsett Case, is a troubled computer hacker and drug addict. In the book Mr. Gibson describes cyberspace as \u201ca consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators\u201d and \u201ca graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system.\u201d\n(2) His literary creation turned out to be remarkably prescient(\u6709\u5148\u89c1\u4e4b\u660e\u7684). Cyberspace has become symbolic of the computing devices, networks, fibre-optic cables, wireless links and other infrastructure that bring the internet to billions of people around the world. The myriad connections forged by these technologies have brought tremendous benefits to everyone who uses the web to tap into humanity\u2019s collective store of knowledge every day.\n(3) But there is a darker side to this extraordinary invention. Data breaches are becoming ever bigger and more common. Last year over 800m records were lost, mainly through such attacks. Among the most prominent recent victims has been Target, whose chief executive, Gregg Steinhafel, stood down from his job in May, a few months after the giant American retailer revealed that online intruders had stolen millions of digital records about its customers, including credit- and debit-card details. Other well-known firms such as Adobe, a tech company, and eBay, an online marketplace, have also been hit.\n(4) The potential damage, though, extends well beyond such commercial incursions. Wider concerns have been raised by the revelations about the mass surveillance carried out by Western intelligence agencies made by Edward Snowden, a contractor to America\u2019s National Security Agency (NSA., as well as by the growing numbers of cyber-warriors being recruited by countries that see cyberspace as a new domain of warfare. America\u2019s president, Barack Obama, said in a White House press release earlier this year that cyber-threats \u201cpose one of the gravest national-security dangers\u201d the country is facing.\n(5) Securing cyberspace is hard because the architecture of the internet was designed to promote connectivity, not security. Its founders focused on getting it to work and did not worry much about threats because the network was affiliated with America\u2019s military. As hackers turned up, layers of security, from antivirus programs to firewalls, were added to try to keep them at bay. Gartner, a research firm, reckons that last year organizations around the globe spent $67 billion on information security.\n(6) On the whole, these defenses have worked reasonably well. For all the talk about the risk of a \u201ccyber 9/11\u201d, the internet has proved remarkably resilient. Hundreds of millions of people turn on their computers every day and bank online, shop at virtual stores, swap gossip and photos with their friends on social networks and send all kinds of sensitive data over the web without ill effect. Companies and governments are shifting ever more services online.\n(7) But the task is becoming harder. Cyber-security, which involves protecting both data and people, is facing multiple threats, notably cybercrime and online industrial espionage, both of which are growing rapidly. A recent estimate by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) puts the annual global cost of digital crime and intellectual-property theft at $445 billion\u2014a sum roughly equivalent to the GDP of a smallish rich European country such as Austria.\n(8) To add to the worries, there is also the risk of cyber-sabotage. Terrorists or agents of hostile powers could mount attacks on companies and systems that control vital parts of an economy, including power stations, electrical grids and communications networks. Such attacks are hard to pull off, but not impossible. One precedent is the destruction in 2010 of centrifuges(\u79bb\u5fc3\u673a) at a nuclear facility in Iran by a computer program known as Stuxnet.\n(9) But such events are rare. The biggest day-to-day threats faced by companies and government agencies come from crooks and spooks hoping to steal financial data and trade secrets. For example, smarter, better-organized hackers are making life tougher for the cyber-defenders, but even so a number of things can be done to keep everyone safer than they are now.\n(10) One is to ensure that organizations get the basics of cyber-security right. All too often breaches are caused by simple blunders, such as failing to separate systems containing sensitive data from those that do not need access to them. Companies also need to get better at anticipating where attacks may be coming from and at adapting their defenses swiftly in response to new threats. Technology can help, as can industry initiatives that allow firms to share intelligence about risks with each other.\n(11) There is also a need to provide incentives to improve cyber-security, be they carrots or sticks. One idea is to encourage internet-service providers, or the companies that manage internet connections, to shoulder more responsibility for identifying and helping to clean up computers infected with malicious software. Another is to find ways to ensure that software developers produce code with fewer flaws in it so that hackers have fewer security holes to exploit.\n(12) An additional reason for getting tech companies to give a higher priority to security is that cyberspace is about to undergo another massive change. Over the next few years billions of new devices, from cars to household appliances and medical equipment, will be fitted with tiny computers that connect them to the web and make them more useful. Dubbed \u201cthe internet of things\u201d, this is already making it possible, for example, to control home appliances using smartphone apps and to monitor medical devices remotely.\n(13) But unless these systems have adequate security protection, the internet of things could easily become the internet of new things to be hacked. Plenty of people are eager to take advantage of any weaknesses they may spot. Hacking used to be about geeky college kids tapping away in their bedrooms to annoy their elders.

Wider concerns have been raised by the revelations about the mass surveillance carried out by Western intelligence agencies made by Edward Snowden, a contractor to America\u2019s National Security Agency (NSA., as well as by the growing numbers of cyber-warriors being recruited by countries that see cyberspace as a new domain of warfare. America\u2019s president, Barack Obama, said in a White House press release earlier this year that cyber-threats \u201cpose one of the gravest national-security dangers\u201d the country is facing.\n(5) Securing cyberspace is hard because the architecture of the internet was designed to promote connectivity, not security.

Cyber-security, which involves protecting both data and people, is facing multiple threats, notably cybercrime and online industrial espionage, both of which are growing rapidly.

Terrorists or agents of hostile powers could mount attacks on companies and systems that control vital parts of an economy, including power stations, electrical grids and communications networks. Such attacks are hard to pull off, but not impossible. One precedent is the destruction in 2010 of centrifuges(\u79bb\u5fc3\u673a) at a nuclear facility in Iran by a computer program known as Stuxnet.\n(9) But such events are rare. The biggest day-to-day threats faced by companies and government agencies come from crooks and spooks hoping to steal financial data and trade secrets.

        "(1) I can still remember the faces when I suggested a method of dealing with what most teachers of English considered one of their pet horrors, extended reading. The room was full of tired teachers, and many were quite cynical about the offer to work together to create a new and dynamic approach to the place of stories in the classroom.\n(2) They had seen promises come and go and mere words weren\u2019t going to convince them, which was a shame as it was mere words that we were principally dealing with. Most teachers were unimpressed by the extended reading challenge from the Ministry, and their lack of enthusiasm for the rather dry list of suggested tales was passed on to their students and everyone was pleased when that part of the syllabus was over. It was simply a box ticking exercise. We needed to do, something more. We needed a\u2019 very different approach.\n(3) That was ten years ago. Now we have a different approach, and it works. Here\u2019s how it happened (or, like most good stories, here are the main parts. You have to fill in some of yourself employing that underused classroom device, the imagination.) We started with three main precepts:\n(4) First, it is important to realize that all of us are storytellers, tellers of tales. We all have our own narratives the real stories such as what happened to us this morning or last night, and the ones we have been told by others and we haven\u2019t experienced personally. We could say that our entire lives are constructed as narratives. As a result, we all understand and instinctively feel narrative structure. Binary opposites for example, the tension created between good and bad together with the resolution of that tension through the intervention of time, resourcefulness and virtue\u2014is a concept understood by even the youngest children. Professor Kieran Egan, in his seminal book \u2018Teaching as Storytelling\u2019 warns us not to ignore this innate skill, for it is a remarkable tool for learning.\n(5) We need to understand that writing and reading are two sides of the same coin: an author has not completed the task if the book is not read: the creative circle is not complete without the reader, who will supply their own creative input to the process. Samuel Johnson said: A writer only begins a book. A reader finishes it. In teaching terms, we often forget that reading itself can be a creative process, just as writing is, and we too often relegate it to a means of data collection. We frequently forget to make that distinction when presenting narratives or poetry, and often ask comprehension questions which relate to factual information\u2014who said what and when, rather than speculating on \u2018why\u2019, for example, or examining the context of the action.\n(6) The third part of the reasoning that we adopted relates to the need to engage the students as readers in their own right, not simply as language learners; learning the language is part of the process, not the reason for reading. What they read must become theirs and have its own special and secret life in their heads, a place where teachers can only go if invited.\n(7) We quickly found that one of the most important ways of making all the foregoing happen was to engage the creative talents of the class before they read a word of the text. The pre-reading activities become the most important part of the teaching process; the actual reading part can almost be seen as the cream on the cake, and the principle aim of pre-reading activities is to get students to want to read the text. We developed a series of activities which uses clues or fragments from the text yet to be read, and which rely on the students\u2019 innate knowledge of narrative, so that they can build their own stories before they read the key text. They have enough information to generate ideas but not so much that it becomes simply an exercise in guided writing; releasing a free imagination is the objective.\n(8) Moving from pre-reading to reading, we may introduce textual intervention activities. \u2018Textual Intervention\u2019 is a term used by Rob Pope to describe the process of questioning a text not simply as a guide to comprehension but as a way of exploring the context of the story at any one time, and examining points at which the narrative presents choices, points of divergence, or narrative crossroads. We don\u2019t do this for all texts, however, as the shorter ones do not seem to gain much from this process and it simply breaks up the reading pleasure.\n(9) Follow-up activities are needed, at the least, to round off the activity, to bring some sense of closure but they also offer an opportunity to link the reading experience more directly to the requirements of the syllabus. Indeed, the story may have been chosen in the first place because the context supports one of the themes that teachers are required to examine as part of the syllabus\u2014for example, \u2018families\u2019, \u2018science and technology\u2019, \u2018communications\u2019, \u2018the environment\u2019 and all the other familiar themes. For many teachers this is an essential requirement if they are to engage in such extensive reading at all.\n(10) The whole process\u2014pre-, while and post reading\u2014could be just an hour\u2019s activity, or it could last for more than one lesson. When we are designing the materials for exploring stories clearly it isn\u2019t possible for us to know how much time any teacher will have available, which is why we construct the activities into a series of independent units which we call kits. They are called kits because we expect teachers to build their own lessons out of the materials we provide, which implies that large amounts may be discarded. What we do ask, though, is that the pre-reading activities be included, if nothing else. That is essential for the process to engage the student as a creative reader.\n(11) One of the purposes of encouraging a creative reading approach in the language classroom is to do with the dynamics we perceive in the classroom. Strategic theorists tell us of the social trinity, whereby three elements are required to achieve a dynamic in any social situation. In the language classroom these might be seen as consisting of the student, the teacher and the language. Certainly from the perspective of the student\u2014and usually from the perspective of the teacher\u2014the relationship is an unequal one, with the language being perceived as placed closer to the teacher than the student. This will result in less dynamic between language and student than between language and teacher. However, if we replace \u2018language\u2019 with narrative and especially if that is approached as a creative process that draws the student in so that they feel they \u2018own\u2019 the relationship with the text. Then this will shift the dynamic in the classroom so that the student, who has now become a reader, is much closer to the language\u2014or narrative\u2014than previously. This creates a much more effective dynamic of learning. However, some teachers feel threatened by this apparent loss of overall control and mastery. Indeed, the whole business of open ended creativity and a lack of boxes to tick for the correct answer is quite unsettling territory for some to find themselves in.",

And the riots that overtook Los Angeles were a reminder of what knowledgeable observers have been saying for a quarter-century: America will continue paying a high price in civil and ethnic unrest unless the nation commits itself to programs that help the urban poor lead productive and respectable lives.\n(2) Once again, a proven program is worth pondering: national service.\n(3) Somewhat akin to the military training that generations of American males received in the armed forces, a 1990s version would prepare thousands of unemployable and undereducated young adults for quality lives in our increasingly global and technology-driven economy. National service opportunities would be available to any who needed it and, make no mistake, the problems are now so structural, so intractable, that any solution will require massive federal Intervention.\n(4) In his much-quoted book, \u201cThe Truly Disadvantaged,\u201d sociologist William Julius Wilson wrote that \u201conly a major program of economic reform\u201d will prevent the riot-prone urban underclass from being permanently locked out of American economic life. Today, we simply have no choice. The enemy within and among our separate ethnic selves is as daunting as any foreign foe.\n(5) Families who are rent apart by welfare dependency, job discrimination and intense feelings of alienation have produced minority teenagers with very little self-discipline and little faith that good grades and the American work ethic will pay off. A military-like environment for them with practical domestic objectives could produce startling results.\n(6) Military service has been the most successful career training program we\u2019ve ever known, and American children born in the years since the all-volunteer Army was instituted make up a large proportion of this targeted group.

My father enlisted in the CCC as a young man with an elementary school education and he learned invaluable skills that served him well throughout his life. The key was that a job was waiting for him when he finished. The certainty of that first entry-level position is essential if severely alienated young minority men and women are to keep the faith.\n(10) We all know these are difficult times for the public sector, but here\u2019s a chance to add energetic and able manpower to America\u2019s workforce. They could be prepared for the world of work or college\u2014an offer similar to that made to returning GIs after World War \u2161. It would be a chance for 16 to 21-year-olds to live among other cultures, religions, races and in different geographical areas. And these young people could be taught to rally around common goals and friendships that evolve out of pride in one\u2019s squad, platoon, company, battalion\u2014or commander.\n(11) We saw such images during the Persian Gulf War and during the NCAA Final Four basketball games. In military life and competitive sports, this camaraderie doesn\u2019t just happen; it is taught and learned in an atmosphere of discipline and earned mutual respect for each other\u2019s capabilities.\n(12) A national service program would also help overcome two damaging perceptions held by America\u2019s disaffected youth: that society just doesn\u2019t care about minority youngsters and that one\u2019s personal best efforts will not t)e rewarded in our discriminatory job market.

And what better way to answer skeptics from any group than by certifying the technical skills of graduates from a national service training program?\n(13) Now, we must act decisively to forestall future urban unrest. Republicans must put aside their aversion to funding programs aimed at certain cultural groups. Democrats must forget labels and recognize that a geographically isolated subgroup of Americans\u2014their children in particular\u2014need systematic and substantive assistance for at least another 20 years.\n(14) The ethnic taproots of minority Americans are deeply buried in a soft of faith and loyalty to traditional values.

The place is empty, but this doesn\u2019t surprise me at all. I have spent two weeks in this area, driving along empty roads, playing with my son on empty beaches, and staying in B&Bs where we are the only guests.\n(2) No doubt the restaurant, run by two brothers for the past 28 years, is buzzing in July and August, when Portuguese holidaymakers descend on the Alentejo coast. But for the other 10 months of the year, the trickle of diners who come to feast on fantastically fresh seafood reflects the general pace of life in the Alentejo: sleepy, bordering on comatose.\n(3) One of the poorest, least-developed, least-populated regions in western Europe the Alentejo has been dubbed both the Provence and the Tuscany of Portugal. Neither is accurate. Its scenery is not as pretty and, apart from in the capital Evora, its food isn\u2019t as sophisticated. The charms of this land of wheat fields, cork oak forests, wildflower meadows and tiny white-washed villages, are more subtle than in France or Italy\u2019s poster regions.\n(4) To travel here is to step back in time 40 or 50 years. Life rolls along at a treacly pace; there\u2019s an unnerving stillness to the landscape. But that stillness ends abruptly at the Atlantic Ocean, where there is drama in spade. Protected by the South West Alentejo and Costa Vicentina national park, the 100 km of coastline from Porto Covo in the Alentejo to Burgau in the Algarve is the most stunning in Europe. And yet few people seem to know about it. Walkers come to admire the views from the Fisherman\u2019s Way, surfers to ride the best waves in Europe, but day after day we had spectacular beaches to ourselves.\n(5) The lack of awareness is partly a matter of accessibility (these beaches are a good two hours\u2019 drive from either Faro or Lisbon airports) and partly to do with a lack of beach side accommodation. There are some gorgeous, independent guesthouses in this area, but they are hidden in valleys or at the end of dirt tracks.\n(6) Our base was a beautiful 600-acre estate of uncultivated land covered in rock-rose, eucalyptus and wild flowers 13 km inland from Zambujeira. Our one-bedroom home, Azenha, was once home to the miller who tended the now-restored watermill next to it. A kilometre away from the main house, pool and restaurant, it is gloriously isolated.\n(7) Stepping out of the house in the morning to greet our neighbours\u2014wild horses on one side, donkeys on the other\u2014with nothing but birdsong filling the air, I felt a sense of adventure you normally only get with wild camping.\n(8) \u201cWhen people first arrive, they feel a little anxious wondering what they are going to do the whole time,\u201d Sarah Gredley, the English owner of the estate, told me. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t usually take them long to realize that the whole point of being here is to slow down, to enjoy nature.\u201d\n(9) We followed her advice, walking down to the stream in search of terrapins and otters, or through clusters of cork oak trees. On some days, we tramped uphill to the windmill, now a romantic house for two, for panoramic views across the estate and beyond.\n(10) When we ventured out, we were always drawn back to the coast\u2014the gentle sands and shallow bay of Farol beach. At the end of the day, we would head, sandy-footed, to the nearest restaurant, knowing that at every one there would be a cabinet full of fresh seafood to choose from\u2014bass, salmon, lobster, prawns, crabs, goose barnacles, clams ...

After eating platefuls of seafood on the terrace, we wandered down to the harbor where two fishermen, in wetsuits, were setting out by boat across the clear turquoise water to collect goose barnacles.

I have spent two weeks in this area, driving along empty roads, playing with my son on empty beaches, and staying in B&Bs where we are the only guests.\n(2) No doubt the restaurant, run by two brothers for the past 28 years, is buzzing in July and August, when Portuguese holidaymakers descend on the Alentejo coast. But for the other 10 months of the year, the trickle of diners who come to feast on fantastically fresh seafood reflects the general pace of life in the Alentejo: sleepy, bordering on comatose.\n(3) One of the poorest, least-developed, least-populated regions in western Europe the Alentejo has been dubbed both the Provence and the Tuscany of Portugal. Neither is accurate. Its scenery is not as pretty and, apart from in the capital Evora, its food isn\u2019t as sophisticated. The charms of this land of wheat fields, cork oak forests, wildflower meadows and tiny white-washed villages, are more subtle than in France or Italy\u2019s poster regions.\n(4) To travel here is to step back in time 40 or 50 years. Life rolls along at a treacly pace; there\u2019s an unnerving stillness to the landscape. But that stillness ends abruptly at the Atlantic Ocean, where there is drama in spade. Protected by the South West Alentejo and Costa Vicentina national park, the 100 km of coastline from Porto Covo in the Alentejo to Burgau in the Algarve is the most stunning in Europe. And yet few people seem to know about it. Walkers come to admire the views from the Fisherman\u2019s Way, surfers to ride the best waves in Europe, but day after day we had spectacular beaches to ourselves.\n(5) The lack of awareness is partly a matter of accessibility (these beaches are a good two hours\u2019 drive from either Faro or Lisbon airports) and partly to do with a lack of beach side accommodation. There are some gorgeous, independent guesthouses in this area, but they are hidden in valleys or at the end of dirt tracks.\n(6) Our base was a beautiful 600-acre estate of uncultivated land covered in rock-rose, eucalyptus and wild flowers 13 km inland from Zambujeira. Our one-bedroom home, Azenha, was once home to the miller who tended the now-restored watermill next to it. A kilometre away from the main house, pool and restaurant, it is gloriously isolated.\n(7) Stepping out of the house in the morning to greet our neighbours\u2014wild horses on one side, donkeys on the other\u2014with nothing but birdsong filling the air, I felt a sense of adventure you normally only get with wild camping.\n(8) \u201cWhen people first arrive, they feel a little anxious wondering what they are going to do the whole time,\u201d Sarah Gredley, the English owner of the estate, told me. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t usually take them long to realize that the whole point of being here is to slow down, to enjoy nature.\u201d\n(9) We followed her advice, walking down to the stream in search of terrapins and otters, or through clusters of cork oak trees. On some days, we tramped uphill to the windmill, now a romantic house for two, for panoramic views across the estate and beyond.\n(10) When we ventured out, we were always drawn back to the coast\u2014the gentle sands and shallow bay of Farol beach. At the end of the day, we would head, sandy-footed, to the nearest restaurant, knowing that at every one there would be a cabinet full of fresh seafood to choose from\u2014bass, salmon, lobster, prawns, crabs, goose barnacles, clams ... We never ate the same thing twice.\n(11) A kilometre or so from I Cervejaria, on Zambujeira\u2019s idyllic natural harbour is O Sacas, originally built to feed the fishermen but now popular with everyone. After eating platefuls of seafood on the terrace, we wandered down to the harbor where two fishermen, in wetsuits, were setting out by boat across the clear turquoise water to collect goose barnacles. Other than them, the place was deserted\u2014just another empty beauty spot where I wondered for the hundredth time that week how this pristine stretch of coast has remained so undiscovered.",

        "(1) I can still remember the faces when I suggested a method of dealing with what most teachers of English considered one of their pet horrors, extended reading. The room was full of tired teachers, and many were quite cynical about the offer to work together to create a new and dynamic approach to the place of stories in the classroom.\n(2) They had seen promises come and go and mere words weren\u2019t going to convince them, which was a shame as it was mere words that we were principally dealing with. Most teachers were unimpressed by the extended reading challenge from the Ministry, and their lack of enthusiasm for the rather dry list of suggested tales was passed on to their students and everyone was pleased when that part of the syllabus was over. It was simply a box ticking exercise. We needed to do, something more. We needed a\u2019 very different approach.\n(3) That was ten years ago. Now we have a different approach, and it works. Here\u2019s how it happened (or, like most good stories, here are the main parts. You have to fill in some of yourself employing that underused classroom device, the imagination.) We started with three main precepts:\n(4) First, it is important to realize that all of us are storytellers, tellers of tales. We all have our own narratives the real stories such as what happened to us this morning or last night, and the ones we have been told by others and we haven\u2019t experienced personally. We could say that our entire lives are constructed as narratives. As a result, we all understand and instinctively feel narrative structure. Binary opposites for example, the tension created between good and bad together with the resolution of that tension through the intervention of time, resourcefulness and virtue\u2014is a concept understood by even the youngest children. Professor Kieran Egan, in his seminal book \u2018Teaching as Storytelling\u2019 warns us not to ignore this innate skill, for it is a remarkable tool for learning.\n(5) We need to understand that writing and reading are two sides of the same coin: an author has not completed the task if the book is not read: the creative circle is not complete without the reader, who will supply their own creative input to the process. Samuel Johnson said: A writer only begins a book. A reader finishes it. In teaching terms, we often forget that reading itself can be a creative process, just as writing is, and we too often relegate it to a means of data collection. We frequently forget to make that distinction when presenting narratives or poetry, and often ask comprehension questions which relate to factual information\u2014who said what and when, rather than speculating on \u2018why\u2019, for example, or examining the context of the action.\n(6) The third part of the reasoning that we adopted relates to the need to engage the students as readers in their own right, not simply as language learners; learning the language is part of the process, not the reason for reading. What they read must become theirs and have its own special and secret life in their heads, a place where teachers can only go if invited.\n(7) We quickly found that one of the most important ways of making all the foregoing happen was to engage the creative talents of the class before they read a word of the text. The pre-reading activities become the most important part of the teaching process; the actual reading part can almost be seen as the cream on the cake, and the principle aim of pre-reading activities is to get students to want to read the text. We developed a series of activities which uses clues or fragments from the text yet to be read, and which rely on the students\u2019 innate knowledge of narrative, so that they can build their own stories before they read the key text. They have enough information to generate ideas but not so much that it becomes simply an exercise in guided writing; releasing a free imagination is the objective.\n(8) Moving from pre-reading to reading, we may introduce textual intervention activities. \u2018Textual Intervention\u2019 is a term used by Rob Pope to describe the process of questioning a text not simply as a guide to comprehension but as a way of exploring the context of the story at any one time, and examining points at which the narrative presents choices, points of divergence, or narrative crossroads. We don\u2019t do this for all texts, however, as the shorter ones do not seem to gain much from this process and it simply breaks up the reading pleasure.\n(9) Follow-up activities are needed, at the least, to round off the activity, to bring some sense of closure but they also offer an opportunity to link the reading experience more directly to the requirements of the syllabus. Indeed, the story may have been chosen in the first place because the context supports one of the themes that teachers are required to examine as part of the syllabus\u2014for example, \u2018families\u2019, \u2018science and technology\u2019, \u2018communications\u2019, \u2018the environment\u2019 and all the other familiar themes. For many teachers this is an essential requirement if they are to engage in such extensive reading at all.\n(10) The whole process\u2014pre-, while and post reading\u2014could be just an hour\u2019s activity, or it could last for more than one lesson. When we are designing the materials for exploring stories clearly it isn\u2019t possible for us to know how much time any teacher will have available, which is why we construct the activities into a series of independent units which we call kits. They are called kits because we expect teachers to build their own lessons out of the materials we provide, which implies that large amounts may be discarded. What we do ask, though, is that the pre-reading activities be included, if nothing else. That is essential for the process to engage the student as a creative reader.\n(11) One of the purposes of encouraging a creative reading approach in the language classroom is to do with the dynamics we perceive in the classroom. Strategic theorists tell us of the social trinity, whereby three elements are required to achieve a dynamic in any social situation. In the language classroom these might be seen as consisting of the student, the teacher and the language. Certainly from the perspective of the student\u2014and usually from the perspective of the teacher\u2014the relationship is an unequal one, with the language being perceived as placed closer to the teacher than the student. This will result in less dynamic between language and student than between language and teacher. However, if we replace \u2018language\u2019 with narrative and especially if that is approached as a creative process that draws the student in so that they feel they \u2018own\u2019 the relationship with the text. Then this will shift the dynamic in the classroom so that the student, who has now become a reader, is much closer to the language\u2014or narrative\u2014than previously. This creates a much more effective dynamic of learning. However, some teachers feel threatened by this apparent loss of overall control and mastery. Indeed, the whole business of open ended creativity and a lack of boxes to tick for the correct answer is quite unsettling territory for some to find themselves in.",

Certainly from the perspective of the student\u2014and usually from the perspective of the teacher\u2014the relationship is an unequal one, with the language being perceived as placed closer to the teacher than the student. This will result in less dynamic between language and student than between language and teacher. However, if we replace \u2018language\u2019 with narrative and especially if that is approached as a creative process that draws the student in so that they feel they \u2018own\u2019 the relationship with the text. Then this will shift the dynamic in the classroom so that the student, who has now become a reader, is much closer to the language\u2014or narrative\u2014than previously. This creates a much more effective dynamic of learning. However, some teachers feel threatened by this apparent loss of overall control and mastery. Indeed, the whole business of open ended creativity and a lack of boxes to tick for the correct answer is quite unsettling territory for some to find themselves in.",

        "Some of the advantages of bilingualism include better performance at tasks involving \u201cexecutive function\u201d(which involves the brain\u2019s ability to plan and prioritize), better defense against dementia in old age and\u2014the obvious\u2014the ability to speak a second language. One purported advantage was not mentioned, though. Many multilinguals report different personalities, or even different worldviews, when they speak their different languages.\nIt\u2019s an exciting notion, the idea that one\u2019s very self could be broadened by the mastery of two or more languages. In obvious ways (exposure to new friends, literature and so forth) the self really is broadened. Yet it is different to claim\u2014as many people do\u2014to have a different personality when using a different language. A former Economist colleague, for example, reported being ruder in Hebrew than in English. So what is going on here?\nBenjamin Lee Whorf, an American linguist who died in 1941, held that each language encodes a worldview that significantly influences its speakers. Often called \u201cWhorfianism\u201d, this idea has its skeptics, but there are still good reasons to believe language shapes thought.\nThis influence is not necessarily linked to the vocabulary or grammar of a second language. Significantly, most people are not symmetrically bilingual. Many have learned one language at home from parents, and another later in life, usually at school. So bilinguals usually have different strengths and weaknesses in their different languages\u2014and they are not always best in their first language. For example, when tested in a foreign language, people are less likely to fall into a cognitive trap (answering a test question with an obvious-seeming but wrong answer) than when tested in their native language. In part this is because working in a second language slows down the thinking. No wonder people feel different when speaking them. And no wonder they feel looser, more spontaneous, perhaps more assertive or funnier or blunter, in the language they were reared in from childhood.\nWhat of \u201ccrib\u201d bilinguals, raised in two languages? Even they do not usually have perfectly symmetrical competence in their two languages. But even for speakers whose two languages are very nearly the same in ability, there is another big reason that person will feel different in the two languages. This is because there is an important distinction between bilingualism and biculturalism.\nMany bilinguals are not bicultural. But some are. And of those bicultural bilinguals, we should be little surprised that they feel different in their two languages. Experiments in psychology have shown the power of \u201cpriming\u201d\u2014small unnoticed factors that can affect behavior in big ways. Asking people to tell a happy story, for example, will put them in a better mood. The choice between two languages is a huge prime. Speaking Spanish rather than English, for a bilingual and bicultural Puerto Rican in New York, might conjure feelings of family and home. Switching to English might prime the same person to think of school and work.\nSo there are two very good reasons (asymmetrical ability, and priming) that make people feel different speaking their different languages. We are still left with a third kind of argument, though. An economist recently interviewed here at Prospero, Athanasia Chalari, said for example that: Greeks are very loud and they interrupt each other very often. The reason for that is the Greek grammar and syntax. When Greeks talk they begin their sentences with verbs and the form of the verb includes a Lot of information so you already know what they are talking about after the first word and can interrupt more easily.\nIs there something intrinsic to the Greek language that encourages Greeks to interrupt? People seem to enjoy telling tales about their languages\u2019 inherent properties, and how they influence their speakers. A group of French intellectual worthies once proposed, rather self- flatteringly, that French be the sole legal language of the EU, because of its supposedly unmatchable rigor and precision. Some Germans believe that frequently putting the verb at the end of a sentence makes the language especially logical. But language myths are not always self- flattering: many speakers think their languages are unusually illogical or difficult\u2014witness the plethora of books along the lines of \u201cOnly in English do you park on a driveway and drive on a parkway; English must be the craziest language in the world!\u201d We also see some unsurprising overlap with national stereotypes and self-stereotypes: French, rigorous; German, logical; English, playful. Of course.\nIn this case, Ms Chalari, a scholar, at least proposed a specific and plausible line of causation from grammar to personality: in Greek, the verb comes first, and it carries a lot of information, hence easy interrupting. The problem is that many unrelated languages all around the world put the verb at the beginning of sentences. Many languages all around the world are heavily inflected, encoding lots of information in verbs. It would be a striking finding if all of these unrelated languages had speakers more prone to interrupting each other. Welsh, for example, is also both verb-first and about as heavily inflected as Greek, but the Welsh are not known as pushy conversationalists.",

        "Once across the river and into the wholesale district, she glanced about her for some likely door at which to apply. As she contemplated the wide windows and imposing signs, she became conscious of being gazed upon and understood for what she was\u2014a wage-seeker. She had never done this thing before and lacked courage. To avoid conspicuity and a certain indefinable shame she felt at being caught spying about for some place where she might apply for a position, she quickened her steps and assumed an air of indifference supposedly common to one upon an errand. In this way she passed many manufacturing and wholesale houses without once glancing in. At last, after several blocks of walking, she felt that this would not do, and began to look about again, though without relaxing her pace. A little way on she saw a great door which for some reason attracted her attention. It was ornamented by a small brass sign, and seemed to be the entrance to a vast hive of six or seven floors. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d she thought, \u201cthey may want someone\u201d and crossed over to enter, screwing up her courage as she went. When she came within a score of feet of the desired goal, she observed a young gentleman in a grey clerk suit, fumbling his watch-chain and looking out. That he had anything to do with the concern she could not tell, but because he happened to be looking in her direction, her weakening heart misgave her and she hurried by, too overcome with shame to enter in. After several blocks of walking, in which the uproar of the streets and the novelty of the situation had time to wear away the effect of her first defeat, she again looked about. Over the way stood a great six-story structure labeled \u201cStorm and King,\u201d which she viewed with rising hope. It was a wholesale dry goods concern and employed women.

She could scarcely understand her weakness and yet she could not think of gazing inquiringly about upon the surrounding scene. Her feet carried her mechanically forward, every foot of her progress being a satisfactory portion of a flight which she gladly made. Block after block passed by.

She was pleased in part that the streets were bright and clean. The morning sun shining down with steadily increasing warmth made the shady side of the streets pleasantly cool. She looked at the blue sky overhead with more realization of its charm than had ever come to her before.\nHer cowardice began to trouble her in a way. She turned back along the street she had come, resolving to hunt up Storm and King and enter in. On the way she encountered a great wholesale shoe company, through the broad plate windows of which she saw an enclosed executive department, hidden by frosted glass. Without this enclosure, but just within the street entrance, sat a grey-haired gentleman at a small table, with a large open ledger of some kind before him. She walked by this institution several times hesitating, but finding herself unobserved she eventually gathered sufficient courage to falter past the screen door and stood humbly waiting.\n\u201cWell, young lady,\u201d observed the old gentleman, looking at her somewhat kindly\u2014\u201cwhat is it you wish?\u201d\n\u201cI am, that is, do you\u2014I mean, do you need any help?\u201d she stammered.\n\u201cNot just at present,\u201d he answered smiling. \u201cNot just at present.

        "\u201cBritain\u2019s best export,\u201d I was told by the head of the Department of Immigration in Canberra, \u201cis people.\u201d Close on 100,000 people have applied for assisted passages in the first five months of that year, and half of these are eventually expected to migrate to Australia.\nThe Australians are delighted. They are keenly aware that without a strong flow of immigrants into the workforce the development of the Australian economy is unlikely to proceed at the ambitious pace currently envisaged. The new mineral discoveries promise a splendid future, and the injection of huge amounts of American and British capital should help to ensure that they are properly exploited, but with unemployment in Australia down to less than 1.3 percent, the government is understandably anxious to attract more skilled labor.\nAustralia is roughly the same size as the continental United States, but has only twelve million inhabitants. Migration has accounted for half the population increase in the last four years, and has contributed greatly to the country\u2019s impressive economic development. Britain has always been the principal source\u2014ninety percent of Australians are of British descent, and Britain has provided one million migrants since the Second World War.\nAustralia has also given great attention to recruiting people elsewhere. Australians decided they had an excellent potential source of applicants among the so-called \u201cguest workers\u201d who have crossed their own frontiers to work in other parts of Europe. There were estimated to be more than four million of them, and a large number were offered subsidized passages and guaranteed jobs in Australia.

        "Some of the advantages of bilingualism include better performance at tasks involving \u201cexecutive function\u201d(which involves the brain\u2019s ability to plan and prioritize), better defense against dementia in old age and\u2014the obvious\u2014the ability to speak a second language. One purported advantage was not mentioned, though. Many multilinguals report different personalities, or even different worldviews, when they speak their different languages.\nIt\u2019s an exciting notion, the idea that one\u2019s very self could be broadened by the mastery of two or more languages. In obvious ways (exposure to new friends, literature and so forth) the self really is broadened. Yet it is different to claim\u2014as many people do\u2014to have a different personality when using a different language. A former Economist colleague, for example, reported being ruder in Hebrew than in English. So what is going on here?\nBenjamin Lee Whorf, an American linguist who died in 1941, held that each language encodes a worldview that significantly influences its speakers. Often called \u201cWhorfianism\u201d, this idea has its skeptics, but there are still good reasons to believe language shapes thought.\nThis influence is not necessarily linked to the vocabulary or grammar of a second language. Significantly, most people are not symmetrically bilingual. Many have learned one language at home from parents, and another later in life, usually at school. So bilinguals usually have different strengths and weaknesses in their different languages\u2014and they are not always best in their first language. For example, when tested in a foreign language, people are less likely to fall into a cognitive trap (answering a test question with an obvious-seeming but wrong answer) than when tested in their native language. In part this is because working in a second language slows down the thinking. No wonder people feel different when speaking them. And no wonder they feel looser, more spontaneous, perhaps more assertive or funnier or blunter, in the language they were reared in from childhood.\nWhat of \u201ccrib\u201d bilinguals, raised in two languages? Even they do not usually have perfectly symmetrical competence in their two languages. But even for speakers whose two languages are very nearly the same in ability, there is another big reason that person will feel different in the two languages. This is because there is an important distinction between bilingualism and biculturalism.\nMany bilinguals are not bicultural. But some are. And of those bicultural bilinguals, we should be little surprised that they feel different in their two languages. Experiments in psychology have shown the power of \u201cpriming\u201d\u2014small unnoticed factors that can affect behavior in big ways. Asking people to tell a happy story, for example, will put them in a better mood. The choice between two languages is a huge prime. Speaking Spanish rather than English, for a bilingual and bicultural Puerto Rican in New York, might conjure feelings of family and home. Switching to English might prime the same person to think of school and work.\nSo there are two very good reasons (asymmetrical ability, and priming) that make people feel different speaking their different languages. We are still left with a third kind of argument, though. An economist recently interviewed here at Prospero, Athanasia Chalari, said for example that: Greeks are very loud and they interrupt each other very often. The reason for that is the Greek grammar and syntax. When Greeks talk they begin their sentences with verbs and the form of the verb includes a Lot of information so you already know what they are talking about after the first word and can interrupt more easily.\nIs there something intrinsic to the Greek language that encourages Greeks to interrupt? People seem to enjoy telling tales about their languages\u2019 inherent properties, and how they influence their speakers. A group of French intellectual worthies once proposed, rather self- flatteringly, that French be the sole legal language of the EU, because of its supposedly unmatchable rigor and precision. Some Germans believe that frequently putting the verb at the end of a sentence makes the language especially logical. But language myths are not always self- flattering: many speakers think their languages are unusually illogical or difficult\u2014witness the plethora of books along the lines of \u201cOnly in English do you park on a driveway and drive on a parkway; English must be the craziest language in the world!\u201d We also see some unsurprising overlap with national stereotypes and self-stereotypes: French, rigorous; German, logical; English, playful. Of course.\nIn this case, Ms Chalari, a scholar, at least proposed a specific and plausible line of causation from grammar to personality: in Greek, the verb comes first, and it carries a lot of information, hence easy interrupting. The problem is that many unrelated languages all around the world put the verb at the beginning of sentences. Many languages all around the world are heavily inflected, encoding lots of information in verbs. It would be a striking finding if all of these unrelated languages had speakers more prone to interrupting each other. Welsh, for example, is also both verb-first and about as heavily inflected as Greek, but the Welsh are not known as pushy conversationalists.",

        "(1) By the 1840s New York was the leading commercial city of the United States. It had long since outpaced Philadelphia as the largest city in the country, and even though Boston continued to be venerated as the cultural capital of the nation, its image had become somewhat languid; it had not kept up with the implications of the newly industrialized economy, of a diversified ethnic population, or of the rapidly rising middle class. New York was the place where the \u201cnew\u201d America was coming into being, so it is hardly surprising that the modem newspaper had its birth there.\n(2) The penny paper had found its first success in New York. By the mid-1830s Ben Day\u2019s Sun was drawing readers from all walks of life. On the other hand, the Sun was a scanty sheet providing little more than minor diversions; few today would call it a newspaper at all. Day himself was an editor of limited vision, and he did not possess the ability or the imagination to climb the slopes to loftier heights. If real newspapers were to emerge from the public\u2019s demand for more and better coverage, it would have to come from a youthful generation of editors for whom journalism was a totally absorbing profession, an exacting vocational ideal rather than a mere offshoot of job printing.\n(3) By the 1840s two giants burst into the field, editors who would revolutionize journalism, would bring the newspaper into the modem age, and show how it could be influential in the national life. These two giants, neither of whom has been treated kindly by history, were James Gordon Bennett and Horace Greeley. Bennett founded his New York Herald in 1835, less than two years after the appearance of the Sun. Horace Greeley founded his Tribune in 1841. Bennett and Greeley were the most innovative editors in New York until after the Civil War. Their newspapers were the leading American papers of the day, although for completely different reasons. The two men despised each other, although not in the ways that newspaper editors had despised one another a few years before. Neither was a political hack bonded to a political party. Greeley fancied himself a public intellectual. He had strong political views, and he wanted to run for office himself, but party factotum he could never be; he bristled with ideals and causes of his own devising. Officially he was a Whig (and later a Republican), but he seldom gave comfort to his chosen party. Bennett, on the other hand, had long since cut his political ties, and although his paper covered local and national politics fully and he went after politicians with hammer and tongs, Bennett was a cynic, a distruster of all settled values. He did not regard himself as an intellectual, although in fact he was better educated than Greeley. He thought himself only a hard-boiled newspaperman. Greeley was interested in ideas and in what was happening to the country. Bennett was only interested in his newspaper. He wanted to find out what the news was, what people wanted to read. And when he found out he gave it to them.\n(4) As different as Bennett and Greeley were from each other they were also curiously alike. Both stood outside the circle of polite society, even when they became prosperous, and in Bennett\u2019s case, wealthy. Both were incurable eccentrics. Neither was a gentleman. Neither conjured up the picture of a successful editor. Greeley was unkempt, always looking like an unmade bed. Even when he was nationally famous in the 1850s he resembled a clerk in a third-rate brokerage house, with slips of paper\u2014marked-up proofs perhaps\u2014hanging out of his pockets or stuck in his hat. He became fat, was always nearsighted, always peering over spectacles. He spoke in a high-pitched whine (\u54c0\u53f7). Not a few people suggested that he looked exactly like the illustrations of Charles Dickens\u2019s Mr. Pickwick. Greeley provided a humorous description of himself, written under the pretense that it had been the work of his long-time adversary James Fenimore Cooper. The editor was, according to the description, a half-bald, long-legged, slouching individual \u201cso rocking in gait (\u6b65\u6001) that he walks down both sides of the street at once.\u201d\n(5) The appearance of Bennett was somewhat different but hardly more reassuring. A shrewd, wiry (\u7626\u800c\u7ed3\u5b9e\u7684) Scotsman, who seemed to repel intimacy, Bennett looked around at the world with a squinty glare of suspicion. His eyes did not focus right. They seemed to fix themselves on nothing and everything at the same time. He was as solitary as an oyster, the classic loner. He seldom made close friendships and few people trusted him, although nobody who had dealings with him, however brief, doubted his abilities. He, too, could have come out of a book of Dickensian eccentrics, although perhaps Ebenezer Scrooge or Thomas Gradgrind comes to mind rather than the kindly old Mr. Pickwick. Greeley was laughed at but admired; Bennett was seldom laughed at but never admired; on the other hand, he had a hard professional competence and an encyclopedic knowledge of his adopted country, an in-depth learning uncorrupted by vague idealisms. All of this perfectly suited him for the journalism of this confusing age.\n(6) Both Greeley and Bennett had served long, humiliating and disappointing apprenticeships in the newspaper business. They took a long time getting to the top, the only reward for the long years of waiting being that when they had their own newspapers, both knew what they wanted and firmly set about getting it. When Greeley founded the Tribune in 1841 he had the strong support of the Whig party and had already had a short period of modest success as an editor. Bennett, older by sixteen years, found solid commercial success first, but he had no one behind him except himself when he started up the Herald in 1835 in a dingy cellar room at 20 Wall Street. Fortunately this turned out to be quite enough.",

The answer is that the film makers know we always fall for a bandit, and Jagger is set to do for bold Ned Kelly what Brando once did for the arrogant Emiliano Zapata.\n(2) A bandit inhabits a special realm of legend where his deeds are embroidered by others; where his death rather than his life is considered beyond belief; where the men who bring him to \u201cjustice\u201d are afflicted with doubts about their role.\n(3) The bandits had a role to play as definite as that of the authorities who condemned them. These were men in conflict with authority, and, in the absence of strong law or the idea of loyal opposition, they took to the hills. Even there, however, many of them obeyed certain unwritten rules.\n(4) These robbers, who claimed to be something more than mere thieves, had in common, firstly, a sense of loyalty and identity with the peasants they came from. They didn\u2019t steal the peasant\u2019s harvest; they did steal the lord\u2019s.\n(5) And certain characteristics seem to apply to \u201csocial bandits\u201d whether they were in Sicily or Peru. They were generally young men under the age of marriage, predictably the best age for dissidence. Some were simply the surplus male population who had to look for another source of income; others were runaway serfs or ex-soldiers; a minority, though the most interesting, were outstanding men who were unwilling to accept the meek and passive role of peasant.\n(6) They usually operated in bands between ten and twenty strong and relied for survival on difficult terrain and bad transport. And bandits prospered best where authority was merely local\u2014over the next hill and they were free. Unlike the general run of peasantry they had a taste for flamboyant dress and gesture; but they usually shared the peasants\u2019 religious beliefs and superstitions.\n(7) The first sign of a man caught up in the Robin Hood syndrome was when he started out, forced into outlawry as a victim of injustice; and when he then set out to \u201cright wrongs\u201d, first his own and then other people\u2019s. The classic bandit then \u201ctakes from the rich and gives to the poor\u201d in conformity with his own sense of social injustice; he never kills except in self-defense or justifiable revenge; he stays within his community and even returns to it if he can to take up an honorable place; his people admire and help to protect him; he dies through the treason of one of them; he behaves as if invisible and invulnerable; he is a \u201cloyalist\u201d, never the enemy of the king but only of the local oppressors.\n(8) None of the bandits lived up fully to this image of the \u201cnoble robber\u201d and for many the claim of larger motives was often a delusion.\n(9) Yet amazingly, many of these violent men did behave at least half the time in accordance with this idealist pattern. Pancho Villa in Mexico and Salvatore Giuliano in Italy began their careers harshly victimized. Many of their charitable acts later became legends.\n(10) Far from being defeated in death, bandits\u2019 reputation for invincibility was often strengthened by the manner of their dying. The \u201cdirty little coward\u201d who shot Jesse James in the back is in every ballad about him, and the implication is that nothing else could have brought Jesse down. Even when the police claimed the credit, as they tried to do at first with Giuliano\u2019s death, the local people refused to believe it. And not just the bandit\u2019s vitality prompts the people to refuse to believe that their hero has died; his death would be in some way the death of hope.\n(11) For the traditional \u201cnoble robber\u201d represents an extremely primitive form of social protest, perhaps the most primitive there is.

        "(1) When it came to concealing his troubles, Tommy Wilhelm was not less capable than the next fellow. So at least he thought, and there was a certain amount of evidence to back him up. He had once been an actor\u2014no, not quite, an extra\u2014and he knew what acting should be. Also, he was smoking a cigar, and when a man is smoking a cigar, wearing a hat, he has an advantage: it is harder to find out how he feels. He came from the twenty-third floor down to the lobby on the mezzanine to collect his mail before breakfast, and he believed\u2014he hoped\u2014that he looked passably well: doing all right. It was a matter of sheer hope, because there was not much that he could add to his present effort. On the fourteenth floor he looked for his father to enter the elevator; they often met at this hour, on the way to breakfast. If he worried about his appearance it was mainly for his old father\u2019s sake. But there was no stop on the fourteenth, and the elevator sank and sank. Then the smooth door opened and the great dark-red uneven carpet that covered the lobby billowed toward Wilhelm\u2019s feet. In the foreground the lobby was dark, sleepy. French drapes like sails kept out the sun, but three high, narrow windows were open, and in the blue air Wilhelm saw a pigeon about to light on the great chain that supported the marquee of the movie house directly underneath the lobby. For one moment he heard the wings beating strongly.\n(2) Most of the guests at the Hotel Gloriana were past the age of retirement. Along Broadway in the Seventies, Eighties, and Nineties, a great part of New York\u2019s vast population of old men and women lives. Unless the weather is too cold or wet they fill the benches about the tiny railed parks and along the subway gratings from Verdi Square to Columbia University, they crowd the shops and cafeterias, the dime stores, the tearooms, the bakeries, the beauty parlors, the reading rooms and club rooms. Among these old people at the Gloriana, Wilhelm felt out of place. He was comparatively young, in his middle forties, large and blond, with big shoulders; his back was heavy and strong, if already a little stooped or thickened. After breakfast the old guests sat down on the green leather armchairs and sofas in the lobby and began to gossip and look into the papers; they had nothing to do but wait out the day. But Wilhelm was used to an active life and liked to go out energetically in the morning. And for several months, because he had no position, he had kept up his morale by rising early; he was shaved and in the lobby by eight o\u2019clock. He bought the paper and some cigars and drank a Coca-Cola or two before he went in to breakfast with his father. After breakfast\u2014out, out, out to attend to business.

He wore a Countess Mara painted necktie. As Wilhelm approached, Rubin did not see him; he was looking out dreamily at the Hotel Ansonia, which was visible from his comer, several blocks away. The Ansonia, the neighborhood\u2019s great landmark, was built by Stanford White. It looks like a baroque palace from Prague or Munich enlarged a hundred times, with towers, domes, huge swells and bubbles of metal gone green from exposure, iron fretwork and festoons. Black television antennae are densely planted on its round summits. Under the changes of weather it may look like marble or like sea water, black as slate in the fog, white as tufa in sunlight. This morning it looked like the image of itself reflected in deep water, white and cumulous above, with cavernous distortions underneath.

But Wilhelm was used to an active life and liked to go out energetically in the morning. And for several months, because he had no position, he had kept up his morale by rising early; he was shaved and in the lobby by eight o\u2019clock. He bought the paper and some cigars and drank a Coca-Cola or two before he went in to breakfast with his father. After breakfast\u2014out, out, out to attend to business. The getting out had in itself become the chief business. But he had realized that he could not keep this up much longer, and today he was afraid.

It didn\u2019t seem necessary\u2014he was behind the counter most of the time\u2014but he dressed very well. He had on a rich brown suit; the cuffs embarrassed the hairs on his small hands. He wore a Countess Mara painted necktie. As Wilhelm approached, Rubin did not see him; he was looking out dreamily at the Hotel Ansonia, which was visible from his comer, several blocks away. The Ansonia, the neighborhood\u2019s great landmark, was built by Stanford White. It looks like a baroque palace from Prague or Munich enlarged a hundred times, with towers, domes, huge swells and bubbles of metal gone green from exposure, iron fretwork and festoons.

His glance was comic, a comment upon his untidiness. He liked to wear good clothes, but once he had put it on each article appeared to go its own way. Wilhelm, laughing, panted a little; his teeth were small; his cheeks when he laughed and puffed grew round, and he looked much younger than his years.

He did not regard himself as an intellectual, although in fact he was better educated than Greeley. He thought himself only a hard-boiled newspaperman.

They seemed to fix themselves on nothing and everything at the same time. He was as solitary as an oyster, the classic loner. He seldom made close friendships and few people trusted him, although nobody who had dealings with him, however brief, doubted his abilities.

If real newspapers were to emerge from the public\u2019s demand for more and better coverage, it would have to come from a youthful generation of editors for whom journalism was a totally absorbing profession, an exacting vocational ideal rather than a mere offshoot of job printing.\n(3) By the 1840s two giants burst into the field, editors who would revolutionize journalism, would bring the newspaper into the modem age, and show how it could be influential in the national life. These two giants, neither of whom has been treated kindly by history, were James Gordon Bennett and Horace Greeley. Bennett founded his New York Herald in 1835, less than two years after the appearance of the Sun. Horace Greeley founded his Tribune in 1841. Bennett and Greeley were the most innovative editors in New York until after the Civil War. Their newspapers were the leading American papers of the day, although for completely different reasons. The two men despised each other, although not in the ways that newspaper editors had despised one another a few years before. Neither was a political hack bonded to a political party. Greeley fancied himself a public intellectual. He had strong political views, and he wanted to run for office himself, but party factotum he could never be; he bristled with ideals and causes of his own devising. Officially he was a Whig (and later a Republican), but he seldom gave comfort to his chosen party. Bennett, on the other hand, had long since cut his political ties, and although his paper covered local and national politics fully and he went after politicians with hammer and tongs, Bennett was a cynic, a distruster of all settled values. He did not regard himself as an intellectual, although in fact he was better educated than Greeley. He thought himself only a hard-boiled newspaperman. Greeley was interested in ideas and in what was happening to the country. Bennett was only interested in his newspaper. He wanted to find out what the news was, what people wanted to read. And when he found out he gave it to them.\n(4) As different as Bennett and Greeley were from each other they were also curiously alike. Both stood outside the circle of polite society, even when they became prosperous, and in Bennett\u2019s case, wealthy. Both were incurable eccentrics. Neither was a gentleman. Neither conjured up the picture of a successful editor. Greeley was unkempt, always looking like an unmade bed. Even when he was nationally famous in the 1850s he resembled a clerk in a third-rate brokerage house, with slips of paper\u2014marked-up proofs perhaps\u2014hanging out of his pockets or stuck in his hat. He became fat, was always nearsighted, always peering over spectacles. He spoke in a high-pitched whine (\u54c0\u53f7). Not a few people suggested that he looked exactly like the illustrations of Charles Dickens\u2019s Mr. Pickwick. Greeley provided a humorous description of himself, written under the pretense that it had been the work of his long-time adversary James Fenimore Cooper. The editor was, according to the description, a half-bald, long-legged, slouching individual \u201cso rocking in gait (\u6b65\u6001) that he walks down both sides of the street at once.\u201d\n(5) The appearance of Bennett was somewhat different but hardly more reassuring. A shrewd, wiry (\u7626\u800c\u7ed3\u5b9e\u7684) Scotsman, who seemed to repel intimacy, Bennett looked around at the world with a squinty glare of suspicion. His eyes did not focus right. They seemed to fix themselves on nothing and everything at the same time. He was as solitary as an oyster, the classic loner. He seldom made close friendships and few people trusted him, although nobody who had dealings with him, however brief, doubted his abilities. He, too, could have come out of a book of Dickensian eccentrics, although perhaps Ebenezer Scrooge or Thomas Gradgrind comes to mind rather than the kindly old Mr. Pickwick. Greeley was laughed at but admired; Bennett was seldom laughed at but never admired; on the other hand, he had a hard professional competence and an encyclopedic knowledge of his adopted country, an in-depth learning uncorrupted by vague idealisms. All of this perfectly suited him for the journalism of this confusing age.\n(6) Both Greeley and Bennett had served long, humiliating and disappointing apprenticeships in the newspaper business. They took a long time getting to the top, the only reward for the long years of waiting being that when they had their own newspapers, both knew what they wanted and firmly set about getting it. When Greeley founded the Tribune in 1841 he had the strong support of the Whig party and had already had a short period of modest success as an editor. Bennett, older by sixteen years, found solid commercial success first, but he had no one behind him except himself when he started up the Herald in 1835 in a dingy cellar room at 20 Wall Street. Fortunately this turned out to be quite enough.",

        "(1)Like many historical films, Amadeus is far from a faithful account of what is known about the period and the people that it portrays. Events are exaggerated, condensed and simplified, and the complexity of real characters is reduced to suit the needs of a dramatic contrast between good and evil. Such historical liberties are often bemoaned by experts, but few have seemed to mind the wayward story points of Amadeus. This is no doubt partly attributable to the film\u2019s high entertainment value; it is all unusually lively and funny historical film. It revels in the boyish humor and high spirits of its main character, the composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart(1756-1791), played with jubilant gusto by Tom Hulce. But the film\u2019s appeal is also attributable to Mozart\u2019s music. The composer\u2019s vulgar hijinks(\u72c2\u6b22\u4f5c\u4e50) serve as a contrast to the transcendent beauty of his music, beautifully performed on the soundtrack by the Academy of St Martin in the Fields. Thus, even the most stringent historical purists couldn\u2019t help but find something to enjoy in Amadeus.\n(2)For all its liberties, the story is actually based on a real rumor that circulated in Vienna in the 1820s. While gravely ill, the rival composer Antonio Salieri(1750-1825) confessed he had murdered Mozart decades earlier by poisoning him. Salieri was suffering from dementia(\u75f4\u5446) at the time of this confession, and he later withdrew it, but some\u2014including Mozart\u2019s widow Constanze\u2014chose to believe the claim. More than 150 years later, the English playwright Peter Shaffer based the story of Amadeus not just on Salieri\u2019s confession but also the idea that Salieri had suffered from a deep and bitter jealousy of Mozart throughout the ten years that they both lived and worked as composers in Vienna. In the fun-loving Mozart, the story goes, Salieri saw a true genius\u2014one who made his own talent and accomplishments appear mediocre\u2014and this drove him on a vendetta(\u5bbf\u6028) that ultimately culminated in murder.\n(3)Shaffer\u2019s story makes for great drama, but it is, of course, biased against Salieri. In fact, at the time, Salieri was regarded as the more accomplished musician and composer. From the 1770s through the 1790s, he composed dozens of operas, many of them proving popular and considered innovative. A mark of his prominence was his appointment to the influential post of Kapellmeister, or musical director, to the court of Holy Roman Emperor Joseph \u2161. Salieri was also a teacher whose pupils included Ludwig Van Beethoven, Franz Liszt and Franz Schubert. In his private life, he may not have had Mozart\u2019s exuberance but nor was he the lonely and celibate man played with such convincing severity by F. Murray Abraham in Amadeus. Salieri was married at the time he knew Mozart, and he fathered no fewer than eight children.\n(4)If Salieri had little reason to fear or resent Mozart\u2019s success, there was naturally a degree of rivalry between two men working in the same profession and in the same city. Salieri(born near Verona) and Mozart(born in Salzburg) belonged to separate musical groups, and Italian and German opera fell into and out of favor during this period. The composers were therefore vying for work, including the prestigious post of musical tutor to the Princess of Wurttemberg, which Salieri successfully attained. As composers, they saw their operas\u2019 debut side by side, yet there is little evidence of any animosity between them. Mozart did complain in a letter to his father that Joseph \u2161 favored Salieri over all other composers, but that observation was an accurate one. Both Mozart and his father suspected that, behind the scenes, Salieri tried to undermine Mozart\u2019s success, but these were hardly unusual suspicions in a field so reliant on patronage. In public, fellow composers reported that Mozart and Salieri were friendly with another. Shortly after the premiere of Mozart\u2019s The Magic Flute. Salieri attended a performance with Mozart, and applauded warmly and vigorously. Thus, any ill feeling between Mozart and Salieri was borne by the former rather than the latter\u2014contrary to what is strongly depicted in Amadeus\u2014and it stemmed from Salieri\u2019s status and success rather than his perceived mediocrity.\n(5)Mozart\u2019s resentments were those of a younger man struggling for position in the world. Although he had talent, he spent many years struggling to find a suitable post or patronage. He and his father travelled widely during his youth, seeking a distinguished appointment but finding mainly low pay and occasionally humiliating circumstances. It was in the period after 1781, when Mozart defied his father and decided to live and work independently in Vienna that his career flourished. In the space of ten years, he found great success with the operas The Abduction from Seraglio(1782), The Marriage of Figaro(1786), Don Giovanni(1787)and The Magic Flute(1791). These were composed alongside his piano concertos, symphonies and chamber music, and together with his work as a performer and teacher, his success brought a high income. Mozart\u2019s money troubles were the result of excessive spending, and his volatile temperament, rather than any malicious schemes against him. His death, at the age of 35, was not considered suspicious at the time as he had been ill for weeks with a fever. While it is true that he had a commoner\u2019s funeral, in 18th-century Vienna this was not unusual for a man of non-aristocratic standing. It certainly was not a mark of his downfall or ignominy, as implied by the film. At his death, Mozart was second in stature only to Salieri as Vienna\u2019s most prominent musician and composer.\n(6)The drama of Amadeus stems not from historical accuracies, but from our contemporary knowledge that Mozart\u2019s music and reputation have survived for centuries\u2014and continued to find new, zesty audiences\u2014while Salieri\u2019s name and work quickly faded. Mozart\u2019s secondary status during his own lifetime thus appears unjust and unwarranted, and he is invested with the role of the struggling artist and unappreciated genius. This may be shaky history, but the film has enough laughter, conflict, romance and tragedy to please any opera lover, except perhaps for Salieri himself, who undoubtedly would have told the tale in an altogether different key.",

        "(1)Like many historical films, Amadeus is far from a faithful account of what is known about the period and the people that it portrays. Events are exaggerated, condensed and simplified, and the complexity of real characters is reduced to suit the needs of a dramatic contrast between good and evil. Such historical liberties are often bemoaned by experts, but few have seemed to mind the wayward story points of Amadeus. This is no doubt partly attributable to the film\u2019s high entertainment value; it is all unusually lively and funny historical film. It revels in the boyish humor and high spirits of its main character, the composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart(1756-1791), played with jubilant gusto by Tom Hulce. But the film\u2019s appeal is also attributable to Mozart\u2019s music. The composer\u2019s vulgar hijinks(\u72c2\u6b22\u4f5c\u4e50) serve as a contrast to the transcendent beauty of his music, beautifully performed on the soundtrack by the Academy of St Martin in the Fields. Thus, even the most stringent historical purists couldn\u2019t help but find something to enjoy in Amadeus.\n(2)For all its liberties, the story is actually based on a real rumor that circulated in Vienna in the 1820s. While gravely ill, the rival composer Antonio Salieri(1750-1825) confessed he had murdered Mozart decades earlier by poisoning him. Salieri was suffering from dementia(\u75f4\u5446) at the time of this confession, and he later withdrew it, but some\u2014including Mozart\u2019s widow Constanze\u2014chose to believe the claim. More than 150 years later, the English playwright Peter Shaffer based the story of Amadeus not just on Salieri\u2019s confession but also the idea that Salieri had suffered from a deep and bitter jealousy of Mozart throughout the ten years that they both lived and worked as composers in Vienna. In the fun-loving Mozart, the story goes, Salieri saw a true genius\u2014one who made his own talent and accomplishments appear mediocre\u2014and this drove him on a vendetta(\u5bbf\u6028) that ultimately culminated in murder.\n(3)Shaffer\u2019s story makes for great drama, but it is, of course, biased against Salieri. In fact, at the time, Salieri was regarded as the more accomplished musician and composer. From the 1770s through the 1790s, he composed dozens of operas, many of them proving popular and considered innovative. A mark of his prominence was his appointment to the influential post of Kapellmeister, or musical director, to the court of Holy Roman Emperor Joseph \u2161. Salieri was also a teacher whose pupils included Ludwig Van Beethoven, Franz Liszt and Franz Schubert. In his private life, he may not have had Mozart\u2019s exuberance but nor was he the lonely and celibate man played with such convincing severity by F. Murray Abraham in Amadeus. Salieri was married at the time he knew Mozart, and he fathered no fewer than eight children.\n(4)If Salieri had little reason to fear or resent Mozart\u2019s success, there was naturally a degree of rivalry between two men working in the same profession and in the same city. Salieri(born near Verona) and Mozart(born in Salzburg) belonged to separate musical groups, and Italian and German opera fell into and out of favor during this period. The composers were therefore vying for work, including the prestigious post of musical tutor to the Princess of Wurttemberg, which Salieri successfully attained. As composers, they saw their operas\u2019 debut side by side, yet there is little evidence of any animosity between them. Mozart did complain in a letter to his father that Joseph \u2161 favored Salieri over all other composers, but that observation was an accurate one. Both Mozart and his father suspected that, behind the scenes, Salieri tried to undermine Mozart\u2019s success, but these were hardly unusual suspicions in a field so reliant on patronage. In public, fellow composers reported that Mozart and Salieri were friendly with another. Shortly after the premiere of Mozart\u2019s The Magic Flute. Salieri attended a performance with Mozart, and applauded warmly and vigorously. Thus, any ill feeling between Mozart and Salieri was borne by the former rather than the latter\u2014contrary to what is strongly depicted in Amadeus\u2014and it stemmed from Salieri\u2019s status and success rather than his perceived mediocrity.\n(5)Mozart\u2019s resentments were those of a younger man struggling for position in the world. Although he had talent, he spent many years struggling to find a suitable post or patronage. He and his father travelled widely during his youth, seeking a distinguished appointment but finding mainly low pay and occasionally humiliating circumstances. It was in the period after 1781, when Mozart defied his father and decided to live and work independently in Vienna that his career flourished. In the space of ten years, he found great success with the operas The Abduction from Seraglio(1782), The Marriage of Figaro(1786), Don Giovanni(1787)and The Magic Flute(1791). These were composed alongside his piano concertos, symphonies and chamber music, and together with his work as a performer and teacher, his success brought a high income. Mozart\u2019s money troubles were the result of excessive spending, and his volatile temperament, rather than any malicious schemes against him. His death, at the age of 35, was not considered suspicious at the time as he had been ill for weeks with a fever. While it is true that he had a commoner\u2019s funeral, in 18th-century Vienna this was not unusual for a man of non-aristocratic standing. It certainly was not a mark of his downfall or ignominy, as implied by the film. At his death, Mozart was second in stature only to Salieri as Vienna\u2019s most prominent musician and composer.\n(6)The drama of Amadeus stems not from historical accuracies, but from our contemporary knowledge that Mozart\u2019s music and reputation have survived for centuries\u2014and continued to find new, zesty audiences\u2014while Salieri\u2019s name and work quickly faded.

        "(1) In the town there were two mutes, and they were always together. Early every morning they would come out from the house where they lived and walk arm in arm down the street to work. The one who always steered the way was an obese and dreamy Greek. In the summer he would come out wearing a yellow or green polo shirt stuffed sloppily into his trousers in front and hanging loose behind. When it was colder he wore over this a shapeless gray sweater. His face was round and oily, with half-closed eyelids and lips that curved in a gentle, stupid smile. The other mute was tall. His eyes had a quick, intelligent expression. He was always immaculate and very soberly dressed. Every morning the two friends walked silently together until they reached the main street of the town. Then when they came to a certain fruit and candy store they paused for a moment on the sidewalk outside. The Greek Spiros Antonapoulos, worked for his cousin, who owned this fruit store. His job was to make candies and sweets, uncrate the fruits, and keep the place clean. The thin mute, John Singer, nearly always put his hand on his friend\u2019s arm and looked for a second into his face before leaving him. Then after this goodbye Singer crossed the street and walked on alone to the jewelry store where he worked as a silverware engraver. In the late afternoon the friends would meet again. Singer came back to the fruit store and waited until Antonapoulos was ready to go home. The Greek would be lazily unpacking a case of peaches or melons, or perhaps looking at the funny paper in the kitchen behind the store where he cooked. Before their departure Antonapoulos always opened a paper sack he kept hidden during the day on one of the kitchen shelves. Inside were stored various bits of food he had collected\u2014a piece of fruit or samples of candy. Usually before leaving Antonapoulos waddled gently to the glassed case in the front of the store where some meats and cheeses were kept. He glided open the back of the case and his fat hand groped lovingly for some particular dainty inside which he had wanted. Sometimes his cousin who owned the place did not see him. But if he noticed he stared at his cousin with a warning in his tight, pale face. Sadly Antonapoulos would shuffle the morsel from one corner of the ease to the other. During these times Singer stood very straight with his hands in his pockets and looked in another direction. He did not like to watch this little scene between the two Greeks. For, except drinking and a certain solitary secret pleasure, Antonapoulos loved to eat more than anything else in the world.\n(2) In the dusk the two mutes walked slowly home together. At home Singer was always talking to Antonapoulos. His hands shaped the words in a swift series of designs. His face was eager and his gray-green eyes sparkled brightly. With his thin, strong hands he told Antonapoulos all that had happened during the day.\n(3) When back at home, Antonapoulos sat back lazily and looked at Singer. It was seldom that he ever moved his hands to speak at all\u2014and then it was to say that he wanted to eat or to sleep or to drink. These three things he always said with the same vague, fumbling signs. At night, if he were not too drunk, he would kneel down before his bed and pray awhile. Then his plump hands shaped the words Holy Jesus, or God, or Darling Mary. These were the only words Antonapoulos ever said. Singer never knew just how much his friend understood of all the things he told him. But it did not matter.\n(4) They shared the upstairs of a small house near the business section of the town. There were two rooms. On the off stove in the kitchen Antonapoulos cooked all of their meals. There were straight, plain kitchen chairs for Singer and an overstuffed sofa for Antonapoulos. The bedroom was furnished mainly with a large double bed covered with an eiderdown comforter for the big Greek and a narrow iron cot for Singer.\n(5) Dinner always took a long time, because Antonapoulos loved food and he was very slow. After they had eaten, the big Greek would lie back on his sofa and slowly lick over each one of his teeth with his tongue, either from a certain delicacy or because he did not wish to lose the savor of the meal\u2014while Singer washed the dishes.\n(6) Sometimes in the evening the mutes would play chess. Singer had always greatly enjoyed this game, and years before he had tried to teach it to Antonapoulos. At first his friend could not be interested in the reasons for moving the various pieces about on the board. Then Singer began to keep a bottle of something good under the table to be taken out after each lesson. The Greek never got on to the erratic movements of the knights and the sweeping mobility of the queens, but he learned to make a few set, opening moves. He preferred the white pieces and would not play if the black men were given him. After the first moves Singer worked out the game by himself while his friend looked on drowsily. If Singer made brilliant attacks on his oven men so that in the end the black king was killed, Antonapoulos was always very proud and pleased.\n(7) The two mutes had no other friends, and except when they worked they were alone together. Each day was very much like any other day, because they were alone so much that nothing ever disturbed them. Once a week they would go to the library for Singer to withdraw a mystery book and on Friday night they attended a movie. Then on payday they always went to the ten-cent photograph shop above the Army and Navy Store so that Antonapoulos could have his picture taken. These were the only places where they made customary visits. There were many parts in the town that they had never even seen. The town was in the middle of the deep South.

        "(1) In the town there were two mutes, and they were always together. Early every morning they would come out from the house where they lived and walk arm in arm down the street to work. The one who always steered the way was an obese and dreamy Greek. In the summer he would come out wearing a yellow or green polo shirt stuffed sloppily into his trousers in front and hanging loose behind. When it was colder he wore over this a shapeless gray sweater. His face was round and oily, with half-closed eyelids and lips that curved in a gentle, stupid smile. The other mute was tall. His eyes had a quick, intelligent expression. He was always immaculate and very soberly dressed. Every morning the two friends walked silently together until they reached the main street of the town. Then when they came to a certain fruit and candy store they paused for a moment on the sidewalk outside. The Greek Spiros Antonapoulos, worked for his cousin, who owned this fruit store. His job was to make candies and sweets, uncrate the fruits, and keep the place clean. The thin mute, John Singer, nearly always put his hand on his friend\u2019s arm and looked for a second into his face before leaving him. Then after this goodbye Singer crossed the street and walked on alone to the jewelry store where he worked as a silverware engraver. In the late afternoon the friends would meet again. Singer came back to the fruit store and waited until Antonapoulos was ready to go home. The Greek would be lazily unpacking a case of peaches or melons, or perhaps looking at the funny paper in the kitchen behind the store where he cooked. Before their departure Antonapoulos always opened a paper sack he kept hidden during the day on one of the kitchen shelves. Inside were stored various bits of food he had collected\u2014a piece of fruit or samples of candy. Usually before leaving Antonapoulos waddled gently to the glassed case in the front of the store where some meats and cheeses were kept. He glided open the back of the case and his fat hand groped lovingly for some particular dainty inside which he had wanted. Sometimes his cousin who owned the place did not see him. But if he noticed he stared at his cousin with a warning in his tight, pale face. Sadly Antonapoulos would shuffle the morsel from one corner of the ease to the other. During these times Singer stood very straight with his hands in his pockets and looked in another direction. He did not like to watch this little scene between the two Greeks. For, except drinking and a certain solitary secret pleasure, Antonapoulos loved to eat more than anything else in the world.\n(2) In the dusk the two mutes walked slowly home together. At home Singer was always talking to Antonapoulos. His hands shaped the words in a swift series of designs. His face was eager and his gray-green eyes sparkled brightly. With his thin, strong hands he told Antonapoulos all that had happened during the day.\n(3) When back at home, Antonapoulos sat back lazily and looked at Singer. It was seldom that he ever moved his hands to speak at all\u2014and then it was to say that he wanted to eat or to sleep or to drink. These three things he always said with the same vague, fumbling signs. At night, if he were not too drunk, he would kneel down before his bed and pray awhile. Then his plump hands shaped the words Holy Jesus, or God, or Darling Mary. These were the only words Antonapoulos ever said. Singer never knew just how much his friend understood of all the things he told him. But it did not matter.\n(4) They shared the upstairs of a small house near the business section of the town. There were two rooms. On the off stove in the kitchen Antonapoulos cooked all of their meals. There were straight, plain kitchen chairs for Singer and an overstuffed sofa for Antonapoulos. The bedroom was furnished mainly with a large double bed covered with an eiderdown comforter for the big Greek and a narrow iron cot for Singer.\n(5) Dinner always took a long time, because Antonapoulos loved food and he was very slow. After they had eaten, the big Greek would lie back on his sofa and slowly lick over each one of his teeth with his tongue, either from a certain delicacy or because he did not wish to lose the savor of the meal\u2014while Singer washed the dishes.\n(6) Sometimes in the evening the mutes would play chess. Singer had always greatly enjoyed this game, and years before he had tried to teach it to Antonapoulos. At first his friend could not be interested in the reasons for moving the various pieces about on the board. Then Singer began to keep a bottle of something good under the table to be taken out after each lesson. The Greek never got on to the erratic movements of the knights and the sweeping mobility of the queens, but he learned to make a few set, opening moves. He preferred the white pieces and would not play if the black men were given him. After the first moves Singer worked out the game by himself while his friend looked on drowsily. If Singer made brilliant attacks on his oven men so that in the end the black king was killed, Antonapoulos was always very proud and pleased.\n(7) The two mutes had no other friends, and except when they worked they were alone together. Each day was very much like any other day, because they were alone so much that nothing ever disturbed them. Once a week they would go to the library for Singer to withdraw a mystery book and on Friday night they attended a movie. Then on payday they always went to the ten-cent photograph shop above the Army and Navy Store so that Antonapoulos could have his picture taken. These were the only places where they made customary visits. There were many parts in the town that they had never even seen. The town was in the middle of the deep South.

        "(1)Like many historical films, Amadeus is far from a faithful account of what is known about the period and the people that it portrays. Events are exaggerated, condensed and simplified, and the complexity of real characters is reduced to suit the needs of a dramatic contrast between good and evil. Such historical liberties are often bemoaned by experts, but few have seemed to mind the wayward story points of Amadeus. This is no doubt partly attributable to the film\u2019s high entertainment value; it is all unusually lively and funny historical film. It revels in the boyish humor and high spirits of its main character, the composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart(1756-1791), played with jubilant gusto by Tom Hulce. But the film\u2019s appeal is also attributable to Mozart\u2019s music. The composer\u2019s vulgar hijinks(\u72c2\u6b22\u4f5c\u4e50) serve as a contrast to the transcendent beauty of his music, beautifully performed on the soundtrack by the Academy of St Martin in the Fields. Thus, even the most stringent historical purists couldn\u2019t help but find something to enjoy in Amadeus.\n(2)For all its liberties, the story is actually based on a real rumor that circulated in Vienna in the 1820s. While gravely ill, the rival composer Antonio Salieri(1750-1825) confessed he had murdered Mozart decades earlier by poisoning him. Salieri was suffering from dementia(\u75f4\u5446) at the time of this confession, and he later withdrew it, but some\u2014including Mozart\u2019s widow Constanze\u2014chose to believe the claim. More than 150 years later, the English playwright Peter Shaffer based the story of Amadeus not just on Salieri\u2019s confession but also the idea that Salieri had suffered from a deep and bitter jealousy of Mozart throughout the ten years that they both lived and worked as composers in Vienna. In the fun-loving Mozart, the story goes, Salieri saw a true genius\u2014one who made his own talent and accomplishments appear mediocre\u2014and this drove him on a vendetta(\u5bbf\u6028) that ultimately culminated in murder.\n(3)Shaffer\u2019s story makes for great drama, but it is, of course, biased against Salieri. In fact, at the time, Salieri was regarded as the more accomplished musician and composer. From the 1770s through the 1790s, he composed dozens of operas, many of them proving popular and considered innovative. A mark of his prominence was his appointment to the influential post of Kapellmeister, or musical director, to the court of Holy Roman Emperor Joseph \u2161. Salieri was also a teacher whose pupils included Ludwig Van Beethoven, Franz Liszt and Franz Schubert. In his private life, he may not have had Mozart\u2019s exuberance but nor was he the lonely and celibate man played with such convincing severity by F. Murray Abraham in Amadeus. Salieri was married at the time he knew Mozart, and he fathered no fewer than eight children.\n(4)If Salieri had little reason to fear or resent Mozart\u2019s success, there was naturally a degree of rivalry between two men working in the same profession and in the same city. Salieri(born near Verona) and Mozart(born in Salzburg) belonged to separate musical groups, and Italian and German opera fell into and out of favor during this period. The composers were therefore vying for work, including the prestigious post of musical tutor to the Princess of Wurttemberg, which Salieri successfully attained. As composers, they saw their operas\u2019 debut side by side, yet there is little evidence of any animosity between them. Mozart did complain in a letter to his father that Joseph \u2161 favored Salieri over all other composers, but that observation was an accurate one. Both Mozart and his father suspected that, behind the scenes, Salieri tried to undermine Mozart\u2019s success, but these were hardly unusual suspicions in a field so reliant on patronage. In public, fellow composers reported that Mozart and Salieri were friendly with another. Shortly after the premiere of Mozart\u2019s The Magic Flute. Salieri attended a performance with Mozart, and applauded warmly and vigorously. Thus, any ill feeling between Mozart and Salieri was borne by the former rather than the latter\u2014contrary to what is strongly depicted in Amadeus\u2014and it stemmed from Salieri\u2019s status and success rather than his perceived mediocrity.\n(5)Mozart\u2019s resentments were those of a younger man struggling for position in the world. Although he had talent, he spent many years struggling to find a suitable post or patronage. He and his father travelled widely during his youth, seeking a distinguished appointment but finding mainly low pay and occasionally humiliating circumstances. It was in the period after 1781, when Mozart defied his father and decided to live and work independently in Vienna that his career flourished. In the space of ten years, he found great success with the operas The Abduction from Seraglio(1782), The Marriage of Figaro(1786), Don Giovanni(1787)and The Magic Flute(1791). These were composed alongside his piano concertos, symphonies and chamber music, and together with his work as a performer and teacher, his success brought a high income. Mozart\u2019s money troubles were the result of excessive spending, and his volatile temperament, rather than any malicious schemes against him. His death, at the age of 35, was not considered suspicious at the time as he had been ill for weeks with a fever. While it is true that he had a commoner\u2019s funeral, in 18th-century Vienna this was not unusual for a man of non-aristocratic standing. It certainly was not a mark of his downfall or ignominy, as implied by the film. At his death, Mozart was second in stature only to Salieri as Vienna\u2019s most prominent musician and composer.\n(6)The drama of Amadeus stems not from historical accuracies, but from our contemporary knowledge that Mozart\u2019s music and reputation have survived for centuries\u2014and continued to find new, zesty audiences\u2014while Salieri\u2019s name and work quickly faded. Mozart\u2019s secondary status during his own lifetime thus appears unjust and unwarranted, and he is invested with the role of the struggling artist and unappreciated genius. This may be shaky history, but the film has enough laughter, conflict, romance and tragedy to please any opera lover, except perhaps for Salieri himself, who undoubtedly would have told the tale in an altogether different key.",

        "(1) Vast stretches of central Asia feel eerily uninhabited. Fly at 30,000 feet over the southern part of the former Soviet Union and there are long moments when no town or road or field is visible from your window.\nThe landscape of stark desert, trackless steppe (\u5927\u8349\u539f), and rugged mountains seems to swallow up anything human. It is little surprise, then, that this region remains largely unknown to most archaeologists.\n(2) Wandering bands and tribes roamed this immense area for 5,000 years, herding goat, sheep, cattle, and horses across immense steppes, through narrow valleys, and over high snowy passes. They left occasional tombs that survived the ages, and on rare occasions settled down and built towns or even cities. But for the most part, these peoples left behind few physical traces of their origins, beliefs, or ways of life. What we know of these nomadic pastoralists comes mainly from their periodic forays into India, the Middle East, and China, where they often wreaked havoc and earned a fearsome reputation as enemies of urban life.\n(3) In the past century, scholars criticized these people as destructive, dismissed them as marginal, or, at best, cast them as a harsh tonic for restoring vigor to decaying and soft agricultural societies from ancient Mesopotamia to Imperial Rome to Han China. In the 1950Js, a British archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler blamed the aggressive, chariot-driving Aryans who swept in from the steppes for the demise of the peaceful Indus River civilization after 1800 B.C., though later archaeologists dismissed that claim.\n(4) But Michael Frachetti, a young archaeologist at Washington University in St. Louis, takes the radical view that Central Asians were early midwives in the birth of civilization rather than a destructive force. Frachetti argues that ancient pastoralists living in the third millennium B.C., at the time of the first great cities of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and the Indus, created a network stretching across thousands of miles that passed along goods, technologies, and ideas central to urban life. He believes they helped create civilization rather than hindering it.\n(5) Most archaeological work in Central Asia during the past century has focused on the open and rolling plains that stretch from the Black Sea to Manchuria. These steppes only came to life after 2000 B.C., when horse domestication and riding suddenly turned a forbidding landscape for pedestrians into a natural highway of grass.\n(6) By contrast, the areas to the south of the steppes have long been dismissed as backwaters of history. In the past, these southern mountains and deserts were considered too remote, rugged, and inhospitable to have played a role in early migrations or the emergence of urban life. The Karakum Desert, where it might rain once in a decade, covers nearly two-thirds of today\u2019s Turkmenistan, while the perpetually snow-covered Tian Shan Mountains of western China and eastern Kyrgyzstan soar 24,000 feet into the thin air. It is there that Frachetti and a new generation of archaeologists from the United States and Central Asian nations are discovering evidence of a network of pastoralists who thrived centuries before hooves resounded on the steppes to the north. These forgotten peoples may have carried such markers of civilization as ceramics and grains across thousands of miles, two millennia before the Silk Road linked the Roman Empire with Han China. Frachetti argues that the new data emerging from the region force archaeologists to rethink their ideas about trade across Eurasia during the Bronze Age, when the first civilizations were taking form to the east, south, and west.\n(7) Frachetti, who has studied modern-day pastoralists in such unforgiving landscapes as the Sahara and Scandinavia, was drawn to the southern region of Central Asia for its environmental diversity of desert, grassland, and meadows. Instead of a wasteland, he saw an ideal landscape for enterprising herders who wanted to pasture their animals in all seasons. Together with his colleagues, Frachetti began digging a decade ago in the Dzhungar Mountains of Kazakhstan. Covering nearly 500 square miles, this region lies between the Tian Shan and Altai mountain ranges, and boasts sharp peaks topping 12,000 feet, as well as harsh desert. At a site near a village called Begash, on a flat terrace enclosed by steep canyon walls alongside a small stream, the team uncovered the foundations of simple stone structures along with an array of potsherds (\u9676\u74f7\u788e\u7247) and bronze and stone artifacts in stone-lined oval and rectangular tombs. The earliest layers at Begash date to at least as early as 2500 B. C., based on alpha magnetic spectrometry dating of organic remains, says Frachetti. One woman was laid to rest with a bell-shaped hooked bronze earring around 1700 B.C., according to electron spin resonance dating. Similar earrings are only found several centuries later some 600 miles to the north on the Siberian steppes, hinting at styles that moved north over time.\n(8) More surprisingly, the excavators found wheat, which was first domesticated in the Fertile Crescent of the Middle East, and broomcom millet that was first widely grown in northern China. The grains were used ritually in a burial, and radiocarbon dating of the remains dates them to about 2200 B.C., making them the oldest known domesticated grains in Central Asia. The people of Begash may not have grown either grain\u2014there are no grinding stones, a sign of grain preparation\u2014but instead received it via trade networks stretching from the Near East to China.\n(9) Dorian Fuller, a leading expert in ancient grains based at University College London, calls the finds \u201cimportant and well dated.\u201d He adds that Chinese crops such as millet began to appear in southwest Asia around 1900 B. C., a few centuries after they reached Begash, which could mean the passage through the mountain regions was a means of gradual transmission from east to west. Frachetti speculates that the grains may have been acquired from other tribes and used for ritual purposes, and then perhaps were passed on in turn to other pastoral peoples.\n(10) What makes the Begash discoveries so important is that previously this region was assumed to have been a land of scattered foragers (\u72e9\u730e\u8005) until steppe peoples trickled down into the area\u2019s valleys and mountain ranges after 2000 B.C. But it is becoming evident that the people of Begash were not simple foragers, but sophisticated pastoralists who tended their flocks, much as people in the area still do today. The inhabitants did not begin to use horses until well into the second millennium B.C., and the varieties of sheep and goat found here today appear to be related to the varieties first domesticated thousands of years before in western Iran, near ancient Mesopotamia. This indicates that Begash was \u201cat the crossroads of extremely wide networks among Eurasian communities by the third millennium B.C.,\u201d asserts Frachetti. That doesn\u2019t mean that traders traversed thousands of miles in this early period. Instead, the archaeologist envisions pastoralists taking their flocks to higher pastures in the summer, where they encountered neighbors from other valleys doing the same. Thus, ideas and technologies might have passed gradually through the mountain corridors of southern Central Asia. This corridor, Frachetti believes, may have been a key conduit for Bronze Age developments farther into East Asia and Mongolia.",

But it is becoming evident that the people of Begash were not simple foragers, but sophisticated pastoralists who tended their flocks, much as people in the area still do today. The inhabitants did not begin to use horses until well into the second millennium B.C., and the varieties of sheep and goat found here today appear to be related to the varieties first domesticated thousands of years before in western Iran, near ancient Mesopotamia. This indicates that Begash was \u201cat the crossroads of extremely wide networks among Eurasian communities by the third millennium B.C.,\u201d asserts Frachetti. That doesn\u2019t mean that traders traversed thousands of miles in this early period. Instead, the archaeologist envisions pastoralists taking their flocks to higher pastures in the summer, where they encountered neighbors from other valleys doing the same. Thus, ideas and technologies might have passed gradually through the mountain corridors of southern Central Asia. This corridor, Frachetti believes, may have been a key conduit for Bronze Age developments farther into East Asia and Mongolia.",

        "(1) Early this winter, the hundreds of climbers making plans for spring-summit attempts on Mount Qomolangma suddenly faced a new set of rules. In December, the Nepalese government decreed that it would no longer issue permits to blind, solo, or double-amputee mountaineers for any of its high peaks. Furthermore, all expeditions would have to employ at least one Sherpa (\u590f\u5c14\u5df4\u4eba\u5411\u5bfc\uff09and would be forbidden from using helicopters to reach high camps.\n(2) The regulations fit a pattern established by Nepal\u2019s Ministry of Tourism, which in the past few years has issued a series of proclamations climbers must announce plans to set records, trekkers must carry location beacons\u2014that suggest improved management of its high-altitude peaks. Each new declaration generates a rush of international news reports about authorities making strides toward addressing safety at the top of the world. The truth is a lot more complicated.\n(3) Mountaineering is big business in Nepal. Industry experts estimate that it generates some $26.5 million in tourism income each year, with around $11 million of that coming from Qomolangma climbers alone. The enduring obsession of the Western media with tragic deaths on these far-off snowy peaks has resulted in a lot of free marketing. Nepal\u2019s Ministry of Tourism, perhaps concerned that all the morbid tales might drive climbers to Qomolangma\u2019s less used Chinese side, has gained some control of that narrative by broadcasting more positive developments through the Nepalese press. But the rules announced to date would do nothing to mitigate the dangers of climbing Qomolangma even if Nepal had the resources and conviction to enforce them, which it doesn\u2019t.\n(4) Making a huge, hugely popular mountain safer is possible. On Alaska\u2019s Denali, fulltime climbing rangers conduct safety checks of many teams and are mobilized for rescue operations. On Argentina\u2019s Aconcagua, rangers patrol all high camps, and until recently, permit fees included the cost of helicopter rescues. Adopting similar policies in Nepal would be a good start. A longer list of true reforms would include ordering all climbers to have previously summited a 7,000-meter peak, requiring non-guides working above Base Camp to take a course at the Khumbu Climbing Center (hundreds have done so since it was founded in 2003), and capping the total number of climbers on the mountain at 500 per season, including support staff. That last policy would both reduce dangerous crowding and help keep the mountain clean.\n(5) Unfortunately, these kinds of rules are less likely than ever to be instituted on Qomolangma, owing to the rise of budget guiding companies. Beginning in the early 1990s, Western outfitters established commercial mountaineering on the Nepal side of the peak by attracting clients willing to pay as much as $65,000 to be guided to the summit. That business model dominated for more than two decades, bringing an estimated 9,000 paying climbers to Base Camp. Consequently, Qomolangma earned a reputation as a magnet for the rich, ambitious, and inexperienced.\n(6) As in many markets, savvy entrepreneurs saw opportunities for disruption. Lower-cost guiding companies, some founded by Westerners and others by Nepalese, slowly gained attraction by offering Qomolangma climbs for as little as a third of the going rate among high-end outfitters. Then came 2014, when 16 Sherpas died after a serac (\u51b0\u5854) collapsed onto the Khumbu Icefall, part of the main route from Base Camp to Camp I. In the wake of that tragedy, a small group of Sherpas demanded that the Nepalese government establish regulations that would improve working conditions, increase pay, boost life-insurance coverage, and provide a funeral stipend. Ultimately, Sherpas received a bit more insurance\u2014the minimum payout was doubled from $5,500 to $11,000\u2014but not much else.\n(7) Partly in response to media attention of these events, Nepali-owned guiding companies have continued to gain influence and market share on Qomolangma. The shift away from foreign control of the mountain is welcomed by many in the climbing community. Another positive development: lower-cost operators are increasing diversity on Qomolangma, attracting climbers from China\u2019s and India\u2019s burgeoning middle classes with aggressive pricing. Based on numbers from the Himalayan Database, in 2010, four Indian and eight Chinese climbers attempted the mountain, just 6 percent of the total. Last year, Chinese and Indian clients accounted for 60 of the 199 Nepal-side summits.\n(8) Unfortunately, in the absence of substantive government oversight, some of the budget companies are making Qomolangma more dangerous by flooding the already overcrowded route with novice climbers led by inexperienced guides. Any operators charging less for guided climbs are prone to bolster profits through scale, booking dozens of clients on expeditions. (The most respected outfitters set a maximum of ten.) Putting aside 2014\u2019s tragedy and 2015\u2019s earthquake-induced avalanche, which killed at least 17 people at Base Camp, 12 of the 17 climber deaths on the South Col route between 2011 and 2017 appear to have been clients of budget outfitters.\n(9) During last year\u2019s peak season, Kathmandu-based Seven Summit Treks, known for bringing large groups of climbers to Qomolangma, allegedly promoted a young support staffer named Sange to guide Qomolangma and assigned him to an older Pakistani client. The pair reached the summit late in the day and got into trouble on their descent. They had to be rescued by experienced Sherpas from another Nepalese outfitter. Sange later had all his fingers amputated due to severe frostbite.\n(10) Veteran guides are reacting to all this in different ways. Adrian Ballinger, founder of the California outfitter Alpenglow, has abandoned the Nepal side of Qomolangma and is instead leading teams from China. As he explained it, the higher risk from natural dangers (avalanches, seracs, crevasses), the low standards of other outfitters, and Nepal\u2019s mismanagement add up to an unacceptable environment. Several other prominent guides have come to the same conclusion, including Austrian Lukas Furtenbach. Others are staying put. International Mountain Guides co-owner Eric Simonson, whose first expedition on Qomolangma was in 1982, insists that upgrades in route-making through the Khumbu Icefall, and the establishment of dual ropes in areas prone to bottlenecks, have made the Nepal side safer, even as the crowds have grown.\n(11) Qomolangma remains the ultimate conquest for many climbers. And while most embrace the risk of high-altitude mountaineering, few understand that the biggest dangers are all too often the result of economics, not the forces of nature. Ultimately, the top priority of many tourism officials and outfitters isn\u2019t safety. It\u2019s the bottom line.",

That business model dominated for more than two decades, bringing an estimated 9,000 paying climbers to Base Camp. Consequently, Qomolangma earned a reputation as a magnet for the rich, ambitious, and inexperienced.\n(6) As in many markets, savvy entrepreneurs saw opportunities for disruption. Lower-cost guiding companies, some founded by Westerners and others by Nepalese, slowly gained attraction by offering Qomolangma climbs for as little as a third of the going rate among high-end outfitters. Then came 2014, when 16 Sherpas died after a serac (\u51b0\u5854) collapsed onto the Khumbu Icefall, part of the main route from Base Camp to Camp I. In the wake of that tragedy, a small group of Sherpas demanded that the Nepalese government establish regulations that would improve working conditions, increase pay, boost life-insurance coverage, and provide a funeral stipend. Ultimately, Sherpas received a bit more insurance\u2014the minimum payout was doubled from $5,500 to $11,000\u2014but not much else.\n(7) Partly in response to media attention of these events, Nepali-owned guiding companies have continued to gain influence and market share on Qomolangma. The shift away from foreign control of the mountain is welcomed by many in the climbing community. Another positive development: lower-cost operators are increasing diversity on Qomolangma, attracting climbers from China\u2019s and India\u2019s burgeoning middle classes with aggressive pricing. Based on numbers from the Himalayan Database, in 2010, four Indian and eight Chinese climbers attempted the mountain, just 6 percent of the total. Last year, Chinese and Indian clients accounted for 60 of the 199 Nepal-side summits.\n(8) Unfortunately, in the absence of substantive government oversight, some of the budget companies are making Qomolangma more dangerous by flooding the already overcrowded route with novice climbers led by inexperienced guides. Any operators charging less for guided climbs are prone to bolster profits through scale, booking dozens of clients on expeditions. (The most respected outfitters set a maximum of ten.) Putting aside 2014\u2019s tragedy and 2015\u2019s earthquake-induced avalanche, which killed at least 17 people at Base Camp, 12 of the 17 climber deaths on the South Col route between 2011 and 2017 appear to have been clients of budget outfitters.\n(9) During last year\u2019s peak season, Kathmandu-based Seven Summit Treks, known for bringing large groups of climbers to Qomolangma, allegedly promoted a young support staffer named Sange to guide Qomolangma and assigned him to an older Pakistani client. The pair reached the summit late in the day and got into trouble on their descent. They had to be rescued by experienced Sherpas from another Nepalese outfitter. Sange later had all his fingers amputated due to severe frostbite.\n(10) Veteran guides are reacting to all this in different ways. Adrian Ballinger, founder of the California outfitter Alpenglow, has abandoned the Nepal side of Qomolangma and is instead leading teams from China. As he explained it, the higher risk from natural dangers (avalanches, seracs, crevasses), the low standards of other outfitters, and Nepal\u2019s mismanagement add up to an unacceptable environment.

International Mountain Guides co-owner Eric Simonson, whose first expedition on Qomolangma was in 1982, insists that upgrades in route-making through the Khumbu Icefall, and the establishment of dual ropes in areas prone to bottlenecks, have made the Nepal side safer, even as the crowds have grown.\n(11) Qomolangma remains the ultimate conquest for many climbers.

A longer list of true reforms would include ordering all climbers to have previously summited a 7,000-meter peak, requiring non-guides working above Base Camp to take a course at the Khumbu Climbing Center (hundreds have done so since it was founded in 2003), and capping the total number of climbers on the mountain at 500 per season, including support staff.

        "(1) It was delightful to be in such a place, after long weeks of daily and nightly familiarity with miners\u2019 cabins\u2014with all which this implies of dirt floor, never-made beds, tin plates and cups, bacon and beans and black coffee, and nothing of ornament but war pictures from the Eastern illustrated papers tacked to the log walls. That was all hard, cheerless, materialistic desolation, but here was a nest which had aspects to rest the tired eyes and refresh that something in one\u2019s nature which, after long fasting, recognizes, when confronted by the belongings of art, howsoever cheap and modest they may be, that it has unconsciously been famishing and now has found nourishment.\n(2) I could not have believed that a rag carpet could feast me so, and so content me; or that there could be such solace to the soul in wall-paper and framed lithographs (\u5e73\u7248\u5370\u5237\u753b), and bright-colored tidies and lamp-mats, and Windsor chairs, and varnished whatnots (\u9648\u8bbe\u67b6),with sea-shells and books and china vases on them, and the score of little unclassifiable tricks and touches that a woman\u2019s hand distributes about a home, which one sees without knowing he sees them, yet would miss in a moment if they were taken away. The delight that was in my heart showed in my face, and the man saw it and was pleased; saw it so plainly that he answered it as if it had been spoken.\n(3) \u201cAll her work,\u201d he said, caressingly; \u201cshe did it all herself\u2014every bit,\u201d and he took the room in with a glance which was full of affectionate worship. One of those soft Japanese fabrics with which women drape with careful negligence the upper part of a picture-frame was out of adjustment. He noticed it, and rearranged it with cautious pains, stepping back several times to gauge the effect before he got it to suit him. Then he gave it a light finishing pat or two with his hand, and said: \u201cShe always does that. You can\u2019t tell just what it lacks, but it does lack something until you\u2019ve done that\u2014you can see it yourself after it\u2019s done, but that is all you know; you can\u2019t find out the law of it. It\u2019s like the finishing pats a mother gives the child\u2019s hair after she\u2019s got it combed and brushed, I reckon. I\u2019ve seen her fix all these things so much that I can do them all just her way, though I don\u2019t know the law of any of them. But she knows the law. She knows the why and the how both; but I don\u2019t know the why; I only know the how.\u201d\n(4) He took me into a bedroom so that I might wash my hands; such a bedroom as I had not seen for years; white counterpane, white pillows, carpeted floor, papered walls, pictures, dressing-table, with mirror and pin-cushion and dainty toilet things; and in the comer a wash-stand, with real china-ware bowl and pitcher, and with soap in a china dish, and on a rack more than a dozen towels\u2014towels too clean and white for one out of practice to use without some vague sense of profanation. So my face spoke again, and he answered with gratified words: \u201cAll her work; she did it all herself\u2014every bit. Nothing here that hasn\u2019t felt the touch of her hand. Now you would think\u2014But I mustn\u2019t talk so much.\u201d\n(5) By this time I was wiping my hands and glancing from detail to detail of the room\u2019s belongings, as one is apt to do when he is in a new place, where everything he sees is a comfort to his eye and his spirit; and I became conscious, in one of those unaccountable ways, you know, that there was something there somewhere that the man wanted me to discover for myself. I knew it perfectly, and I knew he was trying to help me by furtive indications with his eye, so I tried hard to get on the right track, being eager to gratify him. I failed several times, as I could see out of the comer of my eye without being told; but at last I knew I must be looking straight at the thing\u2014knew it from the pleasure issuing in invisible waves from him. He broke into a happy laugh, and rubbed his hands together, and cried out: \u201cThat\u2019s it! You\u2019ve found it. I knew you would. It\u2019s her picture. \u201c\n(6) I went to the little black-walnut bracket on the farther wall, and did find there what I had not yet noticed\u2014a picture case. It contained the sweetest girlish face, and the most beautiful, as it seemed to me, that I had ever seen.

She knows the why and the how both; but I don\u2019t know the why; I only know the how.\u201d\n(4) He took me into a bedroom so that I might wash my hands; such a bedroom as I had not seen for years; white counterpane, white pillows, carpeted floor, papered walls, pictures, dressing-table, with mirror and pin-cushion and dainty toilet things; and in the comer a wash-stand, with real china-ware bowl and pitcher, and with soap in a china dish, and on a rack more than a dozen towels\u2014towels too clean and white for one out of practice to use without some vague sense of profanation. So my face spoke again, and he answered with gratified words: \u201cAll her work; she did it all herself\u2014every bit. Nothing here that hasn\u2019t felt the touch of her hand. Now you would think\u2014But I mustn\u2019t talk so much.\u201d\n(5) By this time I was wiping my hands and glancing from detail to detail of the room\u2019s belongings, as one is apt to do when he is in a new place, where everything he sees is a comfort to his eye and his spirit; and I became conscious, in one of those unaccountable ways, you know, that there was something there somewhere that the man wanted me to discover for myself. I knew it perfectly, and I knew he was trying to help me by furtive indications with his eye, so I tried hard to get on the right track, being eager to gratify him. I failed several times, as I could see out of the comer of my eye without being told; but at last I knew I must be looking straight at the thing\u2014knew it from the pleasure issuing in invisible waves from him. He broke into a happy laugh, and rubbed his hands together, and cried out: \u201cThat\u2019s it! You\u2019ve found it. I knew you would. It\u2019s her picture. \u201c\n(6) I went to the little black-walnut bracket on the farther wall, and did find there what I had not yet noticed\u2014a picture case. It contained the sweetest girlish face, and the most beautiful, as it seemed to me, that I had ever seen. The man drank the admiration from my face, and was fully satisfied.\n(7) \u201cNineteen her last birthday,\u201d he said, as he put the picture back; \u201cand that was the day we were married. When you see her\u2014ah, just wait till you see her! \u201c\n(8) \u201cWhere is she? When will she be in?\u201d\n(9) \u201cOh, she\u2019s away now. She\u2019s gone to see her people. They live forty or fifty miles from here. She\u2019s been gone two weeks today.\u201d\n(10) \u201cWhen do you expect her back?\u201d\n(11) \u201cThis is Wednesday. She\u2019ll be back Saturday, in the evening\u2014about nine o\u2019clock, likely.\u201d\n(12) I felt a sharp sense of disappointment.\n(13) \u201cI\u2019m sorry, because I\u2019ll be gone then,\u201d I said, regretfully.\n(14) \u201cGone? No\u2014why should you go? Don\u2019t go. She\u2019ll be disappointed.\u201d\n(15) She would be disappointed\u2014that beautiful creature! If she had said the words herself, they could hardly have blessed me more. I was feeling a deep, strong longing to see her\u2014a longing so supplicating, so insistent, that it made me afraid. I said to myself: \u201cI will go straight away from this place, for my peace of mind\u2019s sake.\u201d\n(16) \u201cYou see, she likes to have people come and stop with us\u2014people who know things, and can talk\u2014people like you. She delights in it; for she knows\u2014oh, she knows nearly everything herself, and can talk, oh, like a bird\u2014and the books she reads, why, you would be astonished. Don\u2019t go; it\u2019s only a little while, you know, and she\u2019ll be so disappointed.\u201d\n(17) I heard the words, but hardly noticed them, I was so deep in my thinkings and strugglings. He left me, but I didn\u2019t know. Presently he was back, with the picture case in his hand, and he held it open before me and said: \u201cThere, now, tell her to her face you could have stayed to see her, and you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d",

        "(1) I\u2019d been living in Los Angeles just under a year when, in the spring of 1983, I answered an ad in the Hollywood Reporter for a receptionist and got the job. The pay wasn\u2019t much, but the work was in \u201cthe Business\u201d\u2014an apt Los Angeles euphemism for the entertainment industry. The location was within bicycling distance of my home, and they only wanted someone to work mornings. I\u2019d get off by 1 p.m., which I thought would leave me plenty of time to do my own writing. I was wrong about that. The place was so frantic I\u2019d come out wired and need the rest of the day to simply calm down. When, after about two weeks, I realized my afternoons were being spent in activities equivalent to running around the block twenty or thirty times, I asked to be put on full-time. Since I wasn\u2019t getting anything else, why not, I figured, jump in for the total experience.\n(2) The (still thriving) company I found myself a part of possessed the unlikely name of Breakdown Services, Ltd. During the six months I worked there, I learned to savor all of that phrase\u2019s more cynical reverberations, but in terms of the job it dealt with the dismantling or breakdown of television and film scripts. Scripts gathered from producers or studios would be regurgitated (\u56de\u6d41) by Breakdown in the form of plot summaries, character descriptions, number of scenes per character, and the number of dialogue lines each speaks. These compilations were then xeroxed and distributed to hundreds of subscribing actors agents who proceeded to submit their clients for likely parts. It was a process, as I was to discover by way of angry phone calls when \u201cbreakdowns\u201d arrived late or not at all, that the agents regarded with a reverence others might reserve for morning prayer.\n(3) Breakdown Services, Ltd. was the brainchild of a young man named Gary Marsh. Gary was twenty-eight when I met him, but he\u2019d founded Breakdown when he was eighteen and was considered something of an entrepreneurial prodigy. His mother was an agent and he\u2019d observed the piles of scripts she and her agent pals had to plow through in order to match a given role with the talent they represented. He\u2019d also observed how much they hated the reading part of their jobs and had cleverly devised breakdowns as a way of extracting the material they needed.\n(4) By the time I arrived, five full-time breakdown writers worked in a desk-lined back room overlooking a parking lot. I\u2019ve heard the current crew has now advanced to computers, but when I was there typewriters were the norm. When they weren\u2019t typing, the writers would curl up on the office\u2019s worn stuffed couch and, with a script propped against one arm, fill legal-sized yellow pads with dialogue line numbers and comments which they\u2019d then type up.

        "(1) My father was, I am sure, intended by nature to be a cheerful, kindly man. Until he was thirty-four years old he worked as a farmhand for a man named Thomas Butterworth whose place lay near the town of Bidwell. He had then a horse of his own and on Saturday evenings drove into town to spend a few hours in social intercourse with other farmhands. In town he drank several glasses of beer and stood about in Ben Head\u2019s saloon\u2014crowded on Saturday evenings with visiting farmhands. Songs were sung and glasses thumped on the bar. At ten o\u2019clock father drove home along a lonely country road, made his horse comfortable for the night and himself went to bed, quite happy in his position in life. He had at that time no notion of trying to rise in the world.\n(2) It was in the spring of his thirty-fifth year that father married my mother, then a country school teacher, and in the following spring I came wriggling and crying into the world.

        "(1) If the properties of human language make it such a unique communication system, quite different from the communication systems of other creatures, then it would seem extremely unlikely that other creatures would be able to understand it. Some humans, however, do not behave as if this is the case. There is, after all, a lot of spoken language directed by humans to animals, apparently under the impression that the animal follows what is being said. Riders can say Whoa to horses and they stop. Should we treat these examples as evidence that non-humans can understand human language? Probably not. The standard explanation is that the animal produces a particular behavior in response to a particular sound-stimulus or noise, but does not actually \u201cunderstand\u201d what the words in the noise mean.\n(2) In an early attempt to teach a chimpanzee to use human language, in the 1930s, two scientists (Luella and Winthrop Kellogg) raised an infant chimpanzee together with their baby son. The chimpanzee, called Gua, was reported to be able to understand about a hundred words, but did not \u201csay\u201d any of them. In the 1940s, a chimpanzee named Viki was reared by another scientist couple (Catherine and Keith Hayes) in their own home, exactly as if she was a human child.

This sign language has all the essential properties of human language and is learned by many congenitally deaf children as their natural first language. From the beginning, the Gardner\u2019s and their research assistants raised Washoe like a human child in a comfortable domestic environment. Sign language was always used when Washoe was around and she was encouraged to use signs. In a period of three and a half years, Washoe came to use signs for more than a hundred words. Even more impressive was Washoe\u2019s ability to take these forms and combine them to produce \u201csentences\u201d of the type gimme tickle, more fruit and open food drink. Some of the forms appear to have been inventions by Washoe, as in her novel sign for \u201cbib\u201d and in the combination \u201cwater bird\u201d\uff08 referring to a swan), which would seem to indicate that her communication system had the potential for productivity.\n(4) At the same time as Washoe was learning sign language, another chimpanzee named Sarah was being taught (by Ann and David Premack) to use a set of plastic shapes for the purpose of communicating with humans. These plastic shapes represented \u201cwords\u201d that could be arranged in sequence to build \u201csentences\u201d. The basic approach was quite different from that of the Gardner\u2019s. Sarah was systematically trained to associate these shapes with objects or actions. She remained an animal in a cage, being trained with food rewards to manipulate a set of symbols. Once she had learned to use a large number of these plastic shapes, Sarah was capable of getting an apple by selecting the correct plastic shape (a blue triangle) from a large array. Sarah was also capable of producing \u201csentences\u201d such as \u201cMary give chocolate Sarah\u201d and had the impressive capacity to understand complex structures such as \u201cIf Sarah put red on green, Mary give Sarah chocolate\u201d.\n(5) A psychologist Herbert Terrace argued that chimpanzees simply produce signs in response to the demands of people and tend to repeat signs those people use, yet they are treated as if they are taking part in a \u201cconversation\u201d. As in many critical studies of animal learning, the chimpanzees\u2019 behavior is viewed as a type of conditioned response to cues provided by human trainers.\n(6) Important lessons have been learned from attempts to teach chimpanzees how to use forms of language. We have answered some questions. Were Washoe and Sarah capable of taking part in interaction with humans by using a symbol system chosen by humans and not chimpanzees? The answer is clearly \u201cYes.\u201d Could Washoe and Sarah go on to perform linguistically on a level comparable to a two-year-old child? The answer is just as clearly \u201cNo.\u201d In arriving at these answers, we have also had to face the fact that, even with our list of key properties, we still don\u2019t seem to have a non-controversial definition of what counts as \u201cusing language\u201d. It has to be fair to say that, in both cases, we observe the participants \u201cusing language\u201d. However, there is a difference.

        "(1) It was well past midnight this past July and the round-the-clock Arctic sun was shining on Mercy Bay. Exhausted Parks Canada archaeologist Ryan Harris was experiencing a rare moment of rest on the rocky beach, looking out over the bay\u2019s dark, ice-studded water. Around him, a dozen red-and-yellow tents lined the shoreline\u2014the only signs of life. Every day for the previous two weeks, work had started by mid-morning and continued nonstop for 16 hours. Night and day had little relevance in the murky, near-freezing waters. Along with Parks Canada\u2019s chief of underwater archaeology, Marc-Andre Bernier, Harris has overseen more than 100 dives at this remote inlet of Banks Island in Aulavik National Park, exploring the wreck of HMS Investigator, a British vessel that has sat on the bottom of the bay for more than 160 years.\n(2) Harris and a small team of archaeologists had discovered Investigator in 2010 and returned in 2011 with a larger team to dive, study, and document the wreck, which holds a critical place in the history of Arctic exploration. Twenty-five feet below the surface, Investigator sits upright, intact, and remarkably well preserved. Silt covers everything below the main deck, entombing the officers\u2019 cabins, the ship\u2019s galley, and a full library. The archaeologists had intended to leave the wreck and its artifacts where they had lain since the polar ship was abandoned, trapped in ice, on June 3, 1853. Artifact recovery was not part of their original plan, but that plan changed after their first few dives.\n(3) The team was instantly surprised by the number of artifacts they saw\u2014muskets (\u706b\u67aa), shoes, and hunks of copper sheathing rested on Investigator\u2019s upper deck, dangled off the hull, or lay haphazardly on the sediment. Leaving these artifacts behind in Mercy Bay would have made them vulnerable to the icebergs that regularly scour the bay\u2019s floor, including the ones the six-man dive team had been dodging since their arrival.\n(4) Each piece fished from the water was a clue to life at sea aboard a ship during a period of British fervor for Arctic exploration. The captain of Investigator, Robert McClure, was originally sent to find and rescue two ships, HMS Erebus and HMS Terror, that Sir John Franklin had led into the Arctic in 1845 to discover the long- sought Northwest Passage connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Investigator\u2019s voyage ended, without sight or word of Franklin\u2019s ships or crew, when it was set upon by ice in Mercy Bay. After 39 months at sea, the listing ship sat, slowly being crushed on all sides, for three frigid years\u2014with no Inuit encounters, no British search parties, and no relief. For much of that time, McClure and his crew of 60 were desperate and under constant threat of starvation, until a surprising rescue in the spring of 1853. Fifty-five men survived the ordeal.\n(5) In July 2010, after months of study to pinpoint Investigator\u2019s resting place, the actual discovery of the wreck took just a few minutes. Harris was in the bay in an inflatable boat testing sonar equipment when the wreck came into range. The four hours of video gathered on that trip showed that the ship was, in essence, frozen in time, protected by the cold water and opaque, light-blocking ice cover. It would be a year before they could return with cold-water diving equipment to have a closer, more detailed look. Over that year, the Parks Canada team pored over photographs and examined glowing gold ultrasound images that showed timber from the wreck scattered across the upper deck like matchsticks. They sought and received the blessing for a more intensive exploration of the wreck site from the 136 residents of Sachs Harbour, an Inuvialuit (Inuit from the western Arctic) community on the southwestern tip of Banks Island, the closest permanent community, some 125 miles away. In addition to the underwater work to document the wreck, archaeologist Henry Cary led a land-based survey and excavation team of Inuvialuit archaeologists, conservation officers, and park staff. It fell upon Cary to shuttle the 8,820 pounds of equipment up to the 74th parallel, including tents, a three-week supply of food, two boats, diving gear, compressors, recording equipment, surveying tools, and 20 barrels for collecting fresh drinking water.\n(6) The archaeologists came prepared for delays, nasty weather, and polar bears\u4e00but they weren\u2019t prepared for the number of artifacts that needed recovery. Harris, Bernier, Cary, and their crews had packed cameras, lasers, and measuring tapes to document the sites but fewer items to help them retrieve, excavate, or transfer artifacts. Recovering the wreck\u2019s finds quickly used up their small toolkit for stabilizing artifacts: foam padding, tongue depressors, and gauze bandages.\n(7) \u201cWe had not really envisioned the number of artifacts that were visible and exposed on the deck. So, basically, we had to improvise,\u201d says Bernier.\n(8) Someone ripped the lid of a large black storage case off its hinges to use as a cradle to lift a bent and corroded musket from the frigid waters. A large food cooler was loaded with a shredded, twisted, oxidized sample of the copper sheathing used by the British navy to reinforce their Arctic fleet for contact with icebergs. To protect a fragile rectangle of encrusted felt\u2014a novel addition to Investigator that was intended to keep the ship watertight\u2014Harris fashioned a cover out of absorbent chamois (\u9e7f\u76ae), ripped up an old black T-shirt to place underneath it, and sandwiched the artifact between floorboards taken from the boat that had shuttled them between land and the wreck. The artifacts then made a more than 4,000-mile journey, by helicopter and commercial airliner, to the Parks Canada conservation lab in Ottawa, where they are being conserved and studied today.",

After 39 months at sea, the listing ship sat, slowly being crushed on all sides, for three frigid years\u2014with no Inuit encounters, no British search parties, and no relief.

It would be a year before they could return with cold-water diving equipment to have a closer, more detailed look. Over that year, the Parks Canada team pored over photographs and examined glowing gold ultrasound images that showed timber from the wreck scattered across the upper deck like matchsticks. They sought and received the blessing for a more intensive exploration of the wreck site from the 136 residents of Sachs Harbour, an Inuvialuit (Inuit from the western Arctic) community on the southwestern tip of Banks Island, the closest permanent community, some 125 miles away. In addition to the underwater work to document the wreck, archaeologist Henry Cary led a land-based survey and excavation team of Inuvialuit archaeologists, conservation officers, and park staff.

        "Dr. Rablen and Dr. Oswald have just published a study which concludes that Nobel science laureates live significantly longer than those of their colleagues who were nominated for a prize, but failed to receive one. They work with data from 1901 to 1950, and the search is restricted to men (to avoid differences in life span between the sexes), and those killed prematurely are eliminated. That gave them 135 prize winners and 389 also-rans.\nThe theory they were testing was that status itself, rather than the trappings of status, such as wealth, act to prolong life. This idea was first declared by Sir Michael Marmot, of University College, London. Sir Michael studied the health of British civil servants and discovered, contrary to his and everyone else\u2019s expectations, that those at the top of the hierarchy\u2014whom the stress of the job was expected to have affected adversely\u2014were actually far healthier than the supposedly unstressed functionaries at the bottom of the heap. Subsequent research has confirmed this result, and suggested it is nothing to do with the larger salaries of those at the top. But Dr. Rablen and Dr. Oswald thought it would be interesting to refine the observation still further, by studying individuals who were all, in a sense, at the top. By comparing people good enough to be considered for a Nobel, they could measure what the status of having one was worth.\nComparing winners and also-rans from within the same countries, to avoid yet another source of bias, Dr. Rablen and Dr. Oswald found that the winners lived, on average, two years longer than those who had merely been nominated. Exactly what causes this increased longevity is unclear. It is not the cash, though. The inflation adjusted value of the prize has fluctuated over the years, so the two researchers were able to see if the purchasing power of the money was correlated with longevity. It was not.\nWith the hierarchically ordered individuals studied by Sir Michael and his successors, both medical records and experiments on animals suggest stress hormones are involved. It is, indeed, more stressful to be at the bottom than the top, even if being at the top involves making decisions on the fate of nations. The result Dr. Rablen and Dr. Oswald have come up with, though, suggests a positive effect associated with high status, rather than the absence of a negative effect, since unsuccessful nominees never know that they have been nominated.\nA similar effect has been noted once before, in a different field. Research published a few years ago by Donald Redelmeier and Sheldon Singh showed that Oscar winning actors and actresses live 3.6 years longer than those who are nominated, but do not win. However, in that case the failed nominees do know that they have failed. And, curiously, Oscar winning scriptwriters live 3.6 years less than do nominees. Perhaps writers, unlike actors and scientists, live in a world of inverted snobbery.",

        "The economy stopped shrinking a year ago, but America\u2019s unemployment problem is as big as ever. The official jobless rate was 9.5% in July, and would be higher still had many people not given up searching for work. Some 45% of the unemployed have been out of a job for more than six months\u2014the highest proportion since the 1930s. And judging by the recent rise in applications for unemployment benefits, the situation may soon get worse rather than better.\nWhy is joblessness still so high? The prevailing view among policymakers is that unemployment is a painful reflection of the economy\u2019s weakness. Americans are out of work because the slump was deep and the recovery has been lacklustre. Stronger demand will eventually solve the problem.\nThe main point of contention is whether policymakers should try to speed up that process with yet more fiscal or monetary stimulus. On the congressional campaign trail Republicans tout high unemployment as proof that stimulus has failed, while Democrats, though they dare not use the \u201cS\u201d word, argue that more must be done to prop up growth. At their annual gathering in Jackson Hole this week, Federal Reserve officials are chewing over when and how the Fed might try to boost the feeble jobs market by printing more money to buy government bonds.\nThis focus on stimulus is understandable. America\u2019s economy is still operating well below its potential and there is little doubt that most of the rise in unemployment is the direct result of this. But unemployment is high for other reasons too\u2014ones largely neglected in the current debate. Thanks to the scale and nature of the housing and financial bust, the labour market has almost certainly become less efficient at matching the supply of jobseekers with the demand for workers.\nPeople saddled with mortgages worth more than their homes are less able to move in pursuit of new jobs. The skills of those out of work\u2014disproportionately low-and medium-skilled men in construction and manufacturing\u2014may not be those that employers now need. Extensions of unemployment insurance by Congress have been necessary but have also reduced incentives to seek work quickly. And long periods of joblessness in themselves make people less employable. All this erodes America\u2019s famed flexibility.\nIf America\u2019s labour market is less efficient, the country\u2019s \u201cstructural\u201d or \u201cnatural\u201d rate of unemployment will be higher. The IMF now reckons it may have risen from 5% before the crisis to 6\u20146.75%. If so, around one-third of the rise in America\u2019s joblessness is impervious to the business cycle and cannot be solved by boosting demand. That possibility suggests that the debate over more stimulus is important, but insufficient. America needs a more comprehensive strategy to combat joblessness. But what exactly should it include? Much of what economists know about structural unemployment has been gleaned from the sorry history of continental Europe, where fat benefits and rigid firing rules dulled labour-market efficiency. That experience mostly offers pointers to what not to do, from adding to employers\u2019 regulatory burdens to letting the long-term jobless shift to the disability rolls.\nGetting the to-do list right is trickier, not least because misguided meddling could make unemployment worse. But two avenues seem worth pursuing. The first is a more determined effort to help those trapped in \u201cnegative equity\u201d to restructure the mortgages on their homes\u2014an area where the Obama administration has been notably timid. The dire figures for house sales during July, released this week, show how urgent this is. Legal changes, such as a revision to the bankruptcy code that allowed judges to reduce mortgage debt, could help. The second line of attack is to overhaul schemes that help workers retrain and encourage them to search for work. That need not mean more spending (though America does spend a lot less than other rich countries on such \u201cactive\u201d labour-market policies). The bigger problem is that existing schemes are fragmented and often ineffective.\nThe speed of the recovery will still be the main influence on the jobless rate. But if a chunk of America\u2019s unemployment is structural, its policymakers need urgently to think beyond stimulus measures, and also to adopt more targeted policies to help the millions stuck in the wrong place with the wrong skills. Otherwise, even a return to brisk economic growth (something that scarcely looks likely right now) will not be enough to rescue them from the breadline.",

But unemployment is high for other reasons too\u2014ones largely neglected in the current debate. Thanks to the scale and nature of the housing and financial bust, the labour market has almost certainly become less efficient at matching the supply of jobseekers with the demand for workers.\nPeople saddled with mortgages worth more than their homes are less able to move in pursuit of new jobs. The skills of those out of work\u2014disproportionately low-and medium-skilled men in construction and manufacturing\u2014may not be those that employers now need. Extensions of unemployment insurance by Congress have been necessary but have also reduced incentives to seek work quickly. And long periods of joblessness in themselves make people less employable. All this erodes America\u2019s famed flexibility.\nIf America\u2019s labour market is less efficient, the country\u2019s \u201cstructural\u201d or \u201cnatural\u201d rate of unemployment will be higher. The IMF now reckons it may have risen from 5% before the crisis to 6\u20146.75%. If so, around one-third of the rise in America\u2019s joblessness is impervious to the business cycle and cannot be solved by boosting demand. That possibility suggests that the debate over more stimulus is important, but insufficient. America needs a more comprehensive strategy to combat joblessness. But what exactly should it include? Much of what economists know about structural unemployment has been gleaned from the sorry history of continental Europe, where fat benefits and rigid firing rules dulled labour-market efficiency. That experience mostly offers pointers to what not to do, from adding to employers\u2019 regulatory burdens to letting the long-term jobless shift to the disability rolls.\nGetting the to-do list right is trickier, not least because misguided meddling could make unemployment worse. But two avenues seem worth pursuing. The first is a more determined effort to help those trapped in \u201cnegative equity\u201d to restructure the mortgages on their homes\u2014an area where the Obama administration has been notably timid. The dire figures for house sales during July, released this week, show how urgent this is. Legal changes, such as a revision to the bankruptcy code that allowed judges to reduce mortgage debt, could help. The second line of attack is to overhaul schemes that help workers retrain and encourage them to search for work. That need not mean more spending (though America does spend a lot less than other rich countries on such \u201cactive\u201d labour-market policies). The bigger problem is that existing schemes are fragmented and often ineffective.\nThe speed of the recovery will still be the main influence on the jobless rate. But if a chunk of America\u2019s unemployment is structural, its policymakers need urgently to think beyond stimulus measures, and also to adopt more targeted policies to help the millions stuck in the wrong place with the wrong skills.

They work with data from 1901 to 1950, and the search is restricted to men (to avoid differences in life span between the sexes), and those killed prematurely are eliminated. That gave them 135 prize winners and 389 also-rans.\nThe theory they were testing was that status itself, rather than the trappings of status, such as wealth, act to prolong life. This idea was first declared by Sir Michael Marmot, of University College, London. Sir Michael studied the health of British civil servants and discovered, contrary to his and everyone else\u2019s expectations, that those at the top of the hierarchy\u2014whom the stress of the job was expected to have affected adversely\u2014were actually far healthier than the supposedly unstressed functionaries at the bottom of the heap. Subsequent research has confirmed this result, and suggested it is nothing to do with the larger salaries of those at the top. But Dr. Rablen and Dr. Oswald thought it would be interesting to refine the observation still further, by studying individuals who were all, in a sense, at the top. By comparing people good enough to be considered for a Nobel, they could measure what the status of having one was worth.\nComparing winners and also-rans from within the same countries, to avoid yet another source of bias, Dr. Rablen and Dr. Oswald found that the winners lived, on average, two years longer than those who had merely been nominated. Exactly what causes this increased longevity is unclear. It is not the cash, though. The inflation adjusted value of the prize has fluctuated over the years, so the two researchers were able to see if the purchasing power of the money was correlated with longevity. It was not.\nWith the hierarchically ordered individuals studied by Sir Michael and his successors, both medical records and experiments on animals suggest stress hormones are involved. It is, indeed, more stressful to be at the bottom than the top, even if being at the top involves making decisions on the fate of nations.

Financial advisers say that in addition to the tax benefits that come from gradually transferring that wealth by reducing the estate to stay under the tax-exempt amount at death, well-to-do individuals\u2014and even those with estates far under the million-dollar mark\u2014are eager to share the money while they are still alive to see its effects. \u201cIt allows senior generations to see how kids and grandkids are using those funds and to get enjoyment out of knowing how the money is spent,\u201d says Mary Ann Sisco, national wealth adviser for JP Morgan\u2019s Private Client Services.\nLisa Tichenor of Dallas advises a foundation created by her son Taylor in honor of her late son, Willie, who died of bone cancer when he was 19. The money, which originally came from a family business, was given to her sons when they were young. Sharing that money now, instead of waiting to pass it on at death, allows her to spend time with Taylor and work on charitable projects with him, she says. \u201cThere is a lot of joy in working together for someone else\u2019s good when you have everything you need,\u201d she says.\nSally Hurme, an attorney with AARP\u2019s consumer protection unit, helped make her recently married daughter\u2019s down payment on a house. But she warns that parents first need to make sure they have enough money to fund their own expenses. \u201cPeople today are living much longer than they used to live, and they may have very high health costs,\u201d she says.\nGiving money away early can serve to teach adult children how to handle wealth, says Jeremy White, a certified public accountant and coauthor of Splitting Heirs: Giving Money and Things to Your Children Without Ruining Their Lives. \u201cYou may be able to give an inheritance sampler,\u201d he says, \u201cand see how the adult child handles that. You\u2019re around while you\u2019re living to give them guidance if asked.\u201d\nSeniors interested in funding education for young grandchildren can put money into a 529 college savings plan, which is shielded from taxes on earnings. While the money still counts as a gift for tax purposes, says Rande Spiegelman, vice president of financial planning for the Schwab Center for Financial Research, it has the benefit of letting donors control how it\u2019s used or even change the beneficiary. Parents and grandparents interested in retaining control over how their money is spent can also add conditions to trust agreements. \u201cYou never know what life will hold for those beneficiaries, but a lot of clients like to try to impart some of their wishes,\u201d says Marianne Kayan, an estate-planning attorney in Bethesda, Md. She says they try to promote \u201cgood behavior\u201d by specifying that the trust distributions should go toward education or that they won\u2019t go to adults who are not working, although the wording often leaves some leeway to allow for full-time parents, for example.\nA recent Bank of America survey of wealthy individuals found that just over 70 percent discuss philanthropy with their children and about 20 percent give their children money to donate. \u201cClients find that philanthropy is the glue that holds the family together. It\u2019s a way to share family stories and values,\u201d says Eileen Wilhem, managing director of Bank of America\u2019s philanthropic management.

The normal bullets used for hunting deer and elk have soft tips so that they spread out on contact and cause devastating fatal wounds. But this special wolf bullet has a hard tip so that it will pass right through the animal, leaving a relatively small (though almost certainly fatal) wound. The dying wolf will then probably walk tens of miles before it dies, thus preventing \u201cthem\u201d from identifying the slayers of this absurdly protected predator.

        "Parents and grandparents with money to spare are no longer waiting until death to pass on their wealth. Instead, they\u2019re increasingly handing it over to their adult kids while they\u2019re still around to see how it\u2019s spent\u2014and, in some cases, lend a hand.\nSome 8.1 percent of American families have net worth in excess of $1 million, according to the Federal Reserve, and almost 2 percent have assets of over $2 million, the amount that is currently excluded from federal estate tax. (In 2009, the excluded amount rises to $3.5 million. There will be no federal estate tax in 2010, after which the excluded amount will return to $1 million, unless Congress acts.) Financial advisers say that in addition to the tax benefits that come from gradually transferring that wealth by reducing the estate to stay under the tax-exempt amount at death, well-to-do individuals\u2014and even those with estates far under the million-dollar mark\u2014are eager to share the money while they are still alive to see its effects. \u201cIt allows senior generations to see how kids and grandkids are using those funds and to get enjoyment out of knowing how the money is spent,\u201d says Mary Ann Sisco, national wealth adviser for JP Morgan\u2019s Private Client Services.\nLisa Tichenor of Dallas advises a foundation created by her son Taylor in honor of her late son, Willie, who died of bone cancer when he was 19. The money, which originally came from a family business, was given to her sons when they were young. Sharing that money now, instead of waiting to pass it on at death, allows her to spend time with Taylor and work on charitable projects with him, she says. \u201cThere is a lot of joy in working together for someone else\u2019s good when you have everything you need,\u201d she says.\nSally Hurme, an attorney with AARP\u2019s consumer protection unit, helped make her recently married daughter\u2019s down payment on a house. But she warns that parents first need to make sure they have enough money to fund their own expenses. \u201cPeople today are living much longer than they used to live, and they may have very high health costs,\u201d she says.\nGiving money away early can serve to teach adult children how to handle wealth, says Jeremy White, a certified public accountant and coauthor of Splitting Heirs: Giving Money and Things to Your Children Without Ruining Their Lives. \u201cYou may be able to give an inheritance sampler,\u201d he says, \u201cand see how the adult child handles that. You\u2019re around while you\u2019re living to give them guidance if asked.\u201d\nSeniors interested in funding education for young grandchildren can put money into a 529 college savings plan, which is shielded from taxes on earnings. While the money still counts as a gift for tax purposes, says Rande Spiegelman, vice president of financial planning for the Schwab Center for Financial Research, it has the benefit of letting donors control how it\u2019s used or even change the beneficiary. Parents and grandparents interested in retaining control over how their money is spent can also add conditions to trust agreements. \u201cYou never know what life will hold for those beneficiaries, but a lot of clients like to try to impart some of their wishes,\u201d says Marianne Kayan, an estate-planning attorney in Bethesda, Md. She says they try to promote \u201cgood behavior\u201d by specifying that the trust distributions should go toward education or that they won\u2019t go to adults who are not working, although the wording often leaves some leeway to allow for full-time parents, for example.\nA recent Bank of America survey of wealthy individuals found that just over 70 percent discuss philanthropy with their children and about 20 percent give their children money to donate. \u201cClients find that philanthropy is the glue that holds the family together. It\u2019s a way to share family stories and values,\u201d says Eileen Wilhem, managing director of Bank of America\u2019s philanthropic management. From the charity recipients to the adult children who help make the gifts and the parents who are still around to see how their money is disbursed, it\u2019s an arrangement with multiple beneficiaries.",

        "In his classic novel, \u201cThe Pioneers\u201d, James Fenimore Cooper has his hero, a land developer, take his cousin on a tour of the city he is building. He describes the broad streets, rows of houses, a teeming metropolis. But his cousin looks around bewildered. All she sees is a stubby forest. \u201cWhere are the beauties and improvements which you were to show me?\u201d she asks. He\u2019s astonished she can\u2019t see them. \u201cWhere! Why everywhere,\u201d he replies. For though they are not yet built on earth, he has built them in his mind, and they are as concrete to him as if they were already constructed and finished.\nCooper was illustrating a distinctly American trait, future-mindedness: the ability to see the present from the vantage point of the future; the freedom to feel unencumbered by the past and more emotionally attached to things to come. \u201cAmerica is therefore the land of the future,\u201d the German philosopher Hegel wrote. \u201cThe America lives even more for his goals, for the future, than the European,\u201d Albert Einstein concurred, \u201cLife for him is always becoming, never being.\u201d\nIn 2012, America will still be the place where the future happens first, for that is the nation\u2019s oldest tradition. The early Puritans lived in almost Stone Age conditions, but they were inspired by vision of future glories, God\u2019s kingdom on earth. The early pioneers would sometimes travel past perfectly good farmland, because they were convinced that even more amazing land could be found over the next ridge. The Founding Fathers took 13 scraggly Colonies and believed they were creating a new nation on earth. The railroad speculators envisioned magnificent fortunes built on bands of iron. It\u2019s now fashionable to ridicule the visions of dot-com entrepreneurs of the 1990s, but they had inherited the urge to leap for the horizon. \u201cThe Future is endowed with such a life, that it lives to us even in anticipation,\u201d Herman Melville wrote. \u201cThe Future is the Bible of the Free.\u201d\nThis future-mindedness explains many modern features of American life. It explains workaholism: the average American works 350 hours a year more than the average European. Americans move more, in search of that brighter tomorrow, than people in other lands. They also, sadly, divorce more, for the same reason. Americans adopt new technologies such as online shopping and credit cards much more quickly than people in other countries. Forty-five percent of world Internet use takes place in the United States. Even today, after the bursting of the stock-market bubble, American venture-capital firms\u2014which are in the business of betting on the future\u2014dwarf the firms from all other nations.\nFuture-mindedness contributes to the disorder in American life, the obliviousness to history, the high rates of family breakdown, the frenzied waste of natural resources. It also leads to incredible innovations. According to the Yale historian Paul Kennedy, 75 percent of the Nobel laureates in economics and the sciences over recent decades have lived or worked in the United States. The country remains a magnet for the future-minded from other nations. One in 12 Americans has enjoyed the thrill and challenge of starting his own business. A study published in the Journal of International Business Studies in 2000 showed that innovative people are spread pretty evenly throughout the globe, but Americans are most comfortable with risk. Entrepreneurs in the US are more likely to believe that they possess the ability to shape their own future than people in, say, Britain, Australia or Singapore.\nIf the 1990s were a great decade of future-mindedness, we are now in the midst of a season of experience. It seems cooler to be skeptical, to pooh-pooh all those IPO suckers who lost their money betting on the telecom future. But the world is not becoming more French. By 2012, this period of chastisement will likely have run its course, and future-mindedness will be back in vogue, for better or worse.\nWe don\u2019t know exactly what the next future-minded frenzy will look like. We do know where it will take place: the American suburb. In 1979, three quarters of American office space were located in central cities. The new companies, research centers and entrepreneurs are flocking to these low buildings near airports, highways and the Wal-Mart malls, and they are creating a new kind of suburban life. There are entirely new metropolises rising boom suburbs like Mesa, Arizona, that already have more people than Minneapolis or St. Louis. We are now approaching a moment in which the majority of American office space, and the hub of American entrepreneurship, will be found in quiet office parks in places like Rockville, Maryland, and in the sprawling suburbosphere around Atlanta.\nWe also know that future-mindedness itself will become the object of greater study. We are discovering that there are many things that human beings do easily that computers can do only with great difficulty, if at all. Cognitive scientists are now trying to decode the human imagination, to understand how the brain visualizes, dreams and creates. And we know, too, that where there is future-mindedness there is hope.",

        "In his classic novel, \u201cThe Pioneers\u201d, James Fenimore Cooper has his hero, a land developer, take his cousin on a tour of the city he is building. He describes the broad streets, rows of houses, a teeming metropolis. But his cousin looks around bewildered. All she sees is a stubby forest. \u201cWhere are the beauties and improvements which you were to show me?\u201d she asks. He\u2019s astonished she can\u2019t see them. \u201cWhere! Why everywhere,\u201d he replies. For though they are not yet built on earth, he has built them in his mind, and they are as concrete to him as if they were already constructed and finished.\nCooper was illustrating a distinctly American trait, future-mindedness: the ability to see the present from the vantage point of the future; the freedom to feel unencumbered by the past and more emotionally attached to things to come. \u201cAmerica is therefore the land of the future,\u201d the German philosopher Hegel wrote. \u201cThe America lives even more for his goals, for the future, than the European,\u201d Albert Einstein concurred, \u201cLife for him is always becoming, never being.\u201d\nIn 2012, America will still be the place where the future happens first, for that is the nation\u2019s oldest tradition. The early Puritans lived in almost Stone Age conditions, but they were inspired by vision of future glories, God\u2019s kingdom on earth. The early pioneers would sometimes travel past perfectly good farmland, because they were convinced that even more amazing land could be found over the next ridge. The Founding Fathers took 13 scraggly Colonies and believed they were creating a new nation on earth. The railroad speculators envisioned magnificent fortunes built on bands of iron. It\u2019s now fashionable to ridicule the visions of dot-com entrepreneurs of the 1990s, but they had inherited the urge to leap for the horizon. \u201cThe Future is endowed with such a life, that it lives to us even in anticipation,\u201d Herman Melville wrote. \u201cThe Future is the Bible of the Free.\u201d\nThis future-mindedness explains many modern features of American life. It explains workaholism: the average American works 350 hours a year more than the average European. Americans move more, in search of that brighter tomorrow, than people in other lands. They also, sadly, divorce more, for the same reason. Americans adopt new technologies such as online shopping and credit cards much more quickly than people in other countries. Forty-five percent of world Internet use takes place in the United States. Even today, after the bursting of the stock-market bubble, American venture-capital firms\u2014which are in the business of betting on the future\u2014dwarf the firms from all other nations.\nFuture-mindedness contributes to the disorder in American life, the obliviousness to history, the high rates of family breakdown, the frenzied waste of natural resources. It also leads to incredible innovations. According to the Yale historian Paul Kennedy, 75 percent of the Nobel laureates in economics and the sciences over recent decades have lived or worked in the United States.

        "Some time ago, the English actor Hugh Grant was arrested by the police in Los Angeles. He was performing a rather private activity in a public place, with a lady of the night. For less famous mortals, such a mishap would have been merely embarrassing, but for such a famous film star the incident proved quite shattering.\nIn this distressing circumstance, he was interviewed by an American journalists who asked him a very American question: \u201cAre you receiving any therapy or counseling?\u201d Grant replied: \u201cNo, in England we read novels.\u201d\nHalf a century earlier, the great psychologist Carl Gustav Jang developed the other side of this same observation. He phrased it in more technical terms: \u201cMan\u2019s estrangement from the mythical realm and the subsequent shrinking of his existence to the mere factual\u2014that is the major cause of mental illness.\u201d In other words, people who do not read fiction or poetry are in permanent danger of crashing against facts and being crushed by reality. And then, in turn, it is left to Dr Jung and his colleagues to rush to the rescue and attempt mending the broken pieces.\nDo psychotherapists multiply when novelists and poets become scarce? There may well be a connection between the development of clinical psychology on the one hand, and the withering of the inspired imagination on the other\u2014at least, this was the belief of some eminent practitioners. Rainer Marie Rilke once begged Lou Andres Salome to psychoanalyze him. She refused explaining: \u201cIf the analysis is successful, you may never write poetry again.\u201d (And just imagine: had a skillful shrink cured Kafka of his existential anxieties, our age\u2014and modern man\u2019s condition-could have been deprived of its most perceptive interpreter.)\nMany strong and well-adjusted people seem to experience little need for the imaginative life. Thus, for instance, saints do not write novels, \u2014as Cardinal Newman observed (and he ought to have known, since he came quite close to being a saint, and he wrote a couple of novels).\nPractical-minded people and men of action are often inclined to disapprove of literary fiction. They consider reading creative literature as a frivolous and debilitating activity. In this respect, it is quite revealing that, for example, the great polar explorer Maws\u2014one of our national heroes gave to his children the stern advice to not waste their time reading novels; instead, he instructed then to read only works of history and biography, in order to grow into healthy individuals.\nThis reflects two very common fallacies. The first consists in failing to see that, by its very definition, all literature is in fact imaginative literature.\nThe second results from a mistaken notion of what \u201chealth\u201d is.\nWhatever fragile harmony we may have been able to achieve within ourselves is exposed every day to dangerous challenges and to ferocious batterings, and the issue of our struggle remains forever uncertain. A character in a novel by Mario Vargas Llosa gave (what seems to me) the best image for this common predicament of ours: \u201cLife is a shitstorm, in which art is our only umbrella.\u201d\nThis observation, in turn, brings us to the very meaning of the NSW Premier\u2019s Literary Awards. Any well-ordered state must naturally provide for public education, public health, public transports, public order, the administration of justice, the collection of garbage, etc. Beyond these essential services and responsibilities, a truly civilized state also ensures that, in the pungent squalls of their daily lives, citizens are not left without umbrellas\u2014and therefore, it encourages and supports the arts.\nThe beauty of all literary awards is that they produce only winners\u2014there can be no losers here, for this is not a competition and, in this respect, actually resembles more a lottery.\nWithout doubting the quality of his work, a writer who receives a literary award is perfectly aware that he is being very lucky indeed. Not only he knows that this honor could have gone to any other writer on the short list, but he also knows that there are many writers not on the shortlist, who may have deserved it equally well; and furthermore, it is quite conceivable that the writer who should have deserved it most did not even succeed in having his manuscript accepted for publication.",
